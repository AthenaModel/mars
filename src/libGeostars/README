Local modifications:

* The header file geoStars.h has been moved to mars/src/include/geostars

* Addition of a Makefile to build mars/lib/libGeostars.a.

* Various clean up to remove warnings generated by gcc -Wall.

* Added the EllipsoidData struct to geoStars.h and function prototypes
  for geoEfg2LlhOpt() and geoLlh2EfgOpt()

* To geoPoint.c, added functions geoEfg2LlhOpt() and geoLlh2EfgOpt()
  that take a pointer to an EllipsoidData struct.  This saves time by
  avoiding ellipsoid data calculations that where done by the original
  versions of these functions.  These calculations only need to be
  done when the reference ellipsoid is changed. This is handled by
  libMarsutil.

Marsbin Package
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This package contains a Tcl extension implemented using the TEA
architecture.  The extension consists of a single binary library
(.so or .dll) and a pkgIndex.tcl file.  It contains a few Tcl commands
that are implemented only in C, and C versions of commands that are
also implemented in pure Tcl in marsutil(n).

The Marsbin package is never loaded explicitly by application code.
Instead, marsutil(n) will load it if it's available, and fall back to
the pure-Tcl code if it is not.  (This allows marsutil(n) to be used
for development on platforms where the C code won't build.)

The top-level build procedure for Marsbin is as follows:

    $ ./configure ...a variety of options...
    $ make
    $ make install

The "make install" copies the built library to mars/lib/Marsbin.

This procedure is handled by the file mars/src/Makefile; thus, the
preferred way to build Marsbin is

    $ cd .../mars/src
    $ make Marsbin

Once the "configure" step has been done once, you can also do this:

    $ cd .../mars/src/Marsbin
    $ make all install

If you omit the "install" step, marsutil(n) won't load the latest
code, and you'll be left wondering what's going on.

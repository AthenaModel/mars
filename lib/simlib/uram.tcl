# uram Type
#
# URAM -- Unified Regional Analysis Model
#
# Instances of the uram object type do the following.
#
#  * Bookkeep URAM inputs.
#  * Recompute URAM outputs as simulation time is advanced.
#  * Allow the owner to enter URAM effects and adjustments
#  * Allow introspection of all inputs and outputs.
#
# Note that the instance of uram cannot "run" on its own; it expects to be
# embedded in a larger simulation which will control the advancement
# of simulation time and enter URAM effects and adjustments as needed.

gui(n) Package
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This package contains reasonably generic GUI settings and components
for use in JNEM.  In principle, these components could be re-used
on another project with minimal conversion effort.

See the gui(n) man page for specifics.

Files with names like "<module>_test.tcl" are test programs for
"<module>.tcl".  They don't use tcltest(n) since the testing
needs to be done interactively.

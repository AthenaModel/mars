# athena-mars TODO List

* Is it necessary to wrap test modules in namespaces for "kite test"?
* Revise marsmisc(n)
  * Split into submodules as appropriate
  * Purge deadwood


* ehtml(n)
  * Complete ehtml(n) testing
  * Refactor API as needed
  * Move basic CSS into ehtml?
* manpage(n)
  * Add test suite
* marsdoc(n)
  * Add test suite.

* Man Page Processing
  * Where do man pages go, when built?
    *   Do they simply live in the docs/manX directory, as now?
    *   A developer has to clone Mars and build the docs by hand?
    *   Perhaps we can push them out to https://oak/kite?
  * At present, man page references can have "roots" so that 
    Athena man pages can refer to Mars man pages or Tcl man pages
    or Tk man pages.  Does that even make sense, with this new world?
  * Athena man pages are now strictly for the developer; but the user
    of Mars might or might not be a developer.
  * An app/appkit could package up the docs, and install them locally.
  * An app/appkit could package up the docs, and display them in a 
    mybrowser (if mybrowser were part of Mars)

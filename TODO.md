# athena-mars TODO List

Current Goals:

* Get Mars 3.0 to where it can support Athena 6.2.

Next:

* Add the mars(1) man pages.

# To Be Cleaned Up

* Consider restructuring marmisc(n).
* Consider breaking the Mars packages up into logical pieces.
* Consider removing uram(n)'s undo/redo capability.  
  * We don't use it, and don't plan to.
  * Then, remove undostack.
* Revise/remove the ENVIRONMENT section in all man pages.
* Revise file headers for the app_* Tcl files.

## After Integration with Athena

Note: you can define snit::widgets without requiring Tk.

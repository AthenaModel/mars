<section SYNOPSIS>

<pre>
package require marsutil 1.0
namespace import ::marsutil::*
</pre>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

A simclock(i) is an object that tracks simulated time.  The
simulated time is a number in integer ticks, beginning with 0 at
simulation start, and incrementing by one or more ticks with each
time step.  In addition to tracking simulated time, a simclock(i)
also provides for the conversion between integer ticks and some
human-readable string value.  For <xref simclock(n)>, for example,
the integer ticks can correspond to a wide range of wallclock time
intervals, and are converted to and from <xref zulu(n)> time
strings.<p>

Many library modules (<xref sqldocument(n)>, <xref logger(n)>)
know how to make use of a simclock(i) if one is available.  The
purpose of this man page is to document the features such an object
needs to have for this purposes.<p>

<section COMMANDS>

Every simclock(i) object provides at least the following
subcommands.<p>

<deflist commands>

<defitem asString {$simclock asString ?<i>offset</i>?}>

Returns the current simulation time as a human-readable time
string.  If given, <i>offset</i> should be an offset in ticks; it is
added to the returned time.  The string format returned is up to the
implementation.<p>

<defitem cget {<i>obj</i> cget <i>option</i>}>

Returns the value of the specified <i>option</i>.<p>

<defitem configure {<i>obj</i> configure <i>option value...</i>}>

Sets the value of one or more of the object's options.  The object
will have at least this option:<p>

<deflist options>

<defopt {-t0 <i>string</i>}>

Sets the simulation start date ("T-zero") to <i>string</i>.<p>

</deflist options>

<defitem now {$simclock now ?<i>offset</i>?}>

Returns the current simulation time in ticks.  If given,
<i>offset</i> should be an offset in ticks; it is added to
the returned time.<p>

<defitem toString {$simclock toString <i>ticks</i> ?<i>offset</i>?}>

Converts a simulation time in integer <i>ticks</i> into a
human-readable time string.  If given,
<i>offset</i> should be an offset in ticks; it is added to
the specified time.<p>
</deflist commands>

<section HISTORY>

Interface derived from the <xref simclock(n)> API, modified to
be agnostic about the implemented string format.<p>

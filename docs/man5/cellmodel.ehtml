<section SYNOPSIS>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

A <i>cell model</i> consists of one or more named <i>cells</i>, each
of which has a numeric value.  A cell's value can be defined as a
numeric constant, or as a formula.  <i>Solving</i> a cell model means
to compute the values of all cells with formulas, iterating if
necessary until the solution is found.  As such, a cell model can be
thought of as a spreadsheet model in which cell names are used instead
of row and column indices.<p>

Cell models are defined using the cellmodel(5) language, which is
defined in this man page.  The <xref cellmodel(n)> module contains
code for the definition and solution of cell models.<p>

<subsection "Cells">

Cells are defined using the <iref let> command:<p>

<pre>
    let A = 5
    let B = 7
    let C = {[A] + [B]}
</pre>

<subsection "Formulas">

The value of a cell can be a constant or a formula.  Formulas are
simply Tcl expressions.  Cell values are retrieved by using the cell's
name as a Tcl command:<p>

<pre>
    let A = 5
    let B = 7
    let C = {[A] + [B]}
</pre>

All of the standard Tcl math operators and functions are available;
see also <xref FUNCTIONS>.  In addition, formulas can be defined
using <xref MACROS>.<p>

<subsection "Pages">

Just as a spreadsheet can contain multiple worksheets, a cell model
can contain multiple pages.  Every cell model begins with a page
called the <b>null</b> page; the model may add additional named
pages.<p>

Each page is associated with a Tcl namespace.  The <b>null</b> page is
associated with the global namespace, and each named page has a
namespace of the same name as a child of the global namespace.  Every
formula is evaluated in the context of its page's namespace.  Thus,
A formula on a given page may refer to cells defined on the same page
by name, and to cells defined on previous pages by qualifying the cell
name with the page name.  (See <xref Formulas>.)  Cells defined on
the <b>null</b> page can be referred to on any page without
qualification.<p>

New pages are created using the <iref page> command.<p>

<pre>
    # These cells are defined on the null page.
    let A = 5
    let B = 7
    
    page P
    
    # C is defined on page P, but can refer to A and B without
    # qualification.
    let C = {[A] + [B]}
    
    page Q
    
    # D and E are defined on page Q, and must refer to cells on
    # page P explicitly.
    
    let D = {[A] + [P::C]}
    let E = {[D] + [P::C]}
</pre>

A cell model's pages are solved in order of definition, starting with
the <b>null</b> page.  Thus, a page can refer to cells on previous
pages, but not to cells on subsequent pages.<p>

Within a page, cells may be defined in any order; it isn't necessary
for a cell to be defined after the cells it references from the same
page.

<subsection "Cyclic vs. Acyclic Pages">

If a page contains two or more cells whose formulas refer to each
other in a circular fashion, the page is said to be <i>cyclic</i>:<p>

<pre>
    let A = {[B] + 1}
    let B = {[A] - 6}
</pre>

When a page is cyclic, <xref cellmodel(n)> will attempt to converge
to a solution using the Gauss-Seidel algorithm; note that there might
not be a valid solution.<p>

If a page contains no circular definitions, it is said to be
<i>acyclic</i>.  In this case, <xref cellmodel(n)> will solve the
formulas on the page in the most efficient order, regardless of the
order in which they are defined.<p>

<subsection "Copying Pages">

It's possible to copy cell definitions onto a new page from a previous
page using the <iref copypage> command.<p>

<section COMMANDS>

A cell model specification is a Tcl script that uses the following
commands to define the cell model.  (Other standard Tcl commands may
be used as well.)<p>

<deflist commands>

<defitem let {let <i>name</i> = <i>constant</i>}>
<defitem let {let <i>name</i> = <i>formula</i> ?<i>options...</i>?}>

The <iref let> command defines a new <b>number</b> cell on the
current page.  The cell <i>name</i> must begin with a letter, and can
contain letters, digits, underscores, and internal periods.  The
formula must be a single token; thus, formulas containing whitespace
must be braced:<p>

<pre>
    let A = 5             ;# Constant cell
    let B = 7             ;# Constant cell
    let C = {[A] + [B]}   ;# Formula cell
</pre>

At present, only one option is defined, and it's of use only for
formula cells:<p>

<deflist options>

<defopt {-value <i>initialValue</i>}>

This option allows the model to assign a formula cell's initial value
explicitly.<p>

Every cell has a numeric value at all times.  Before the model has
been solved, a formula cell's value defaults to 0.  This is fine, on
acyclic pages; on cyclic pages, however, at least one cell will be
referenced before its value has been computed.  Because convergence
often depends on having a good starting point, it's useful to be able
to specify the cell's initial value explicitly.<p>

</deflist options>

<defitem letsym {letsym <i>name</i> = <i>formula</i> ?<i>options...</i>?}>

The <iref letsym> command defines a new <b>symbol</b> cell on the
current page.  The cell <i>name</i> must begin with a letter, and can
contain letters, digits, underscores, and internal periods.  The
formula must be a single token; thus, formulas must be braced:<p>

<pre>
    letsym A = {"Constant String"}
    let    B = 7                   
    letsym C = {[B] &lt; 10 ? "Under 10" : "Over 10"}
</pre>

At present, only one option is defined:<p>

<deflist options>

<defopt {-value <i>initialValue</i>}>

This option allows the model to assign the cell's initial value
explicitly.<p>

</deflist options>

<defitem page {page <i>name</i>}>

Creates a new page called <i>name</i>; subsequent cells will be
defined on this page.  The <i>name</i> must begin with a letter, and
may contains letters, digits, and underscores.<p>

<defitem copypage {copypage <i>page</i> ?<i>options...</i>?}>

Copies cell definitions from the named <i>page</i> to the current
page.  Formula cells are copied as is; constant cells are copied as
formulas referring to the constant value on the copied page.  For
example,<p>

<pre>
    page A

    let X = 5
    let Y = {2*[X]}

    page B
    copypage A
</pre>

will result in the following cell definitions:<p>

<pre>
    A::X = 5
    A::Y = 10 &lt;= 2*[X]
    B::X = 5  &lt;= [A::X]
    B::Y = 10 &lt;= 2*[X]
</pre>

Thus, changing the value of A::Y will change the values of both
A::Y and B::Y.<p>

Copied cell definitions can be overridden using the <iref let>
command.<p>

The following options are defined:<p>

<deflist options>

<defopt {-except <i>cells</i>}>

Specifies a list of cell names to exclude when using the <b>-copy</b>
option.  The new page will not contain the excluded cells.<p>

The cell names should not be qualified.  For example,

<pre>
    copypage P -except {C1 C2 C3}
</pre>

will copy the definitions from page P, except for the definitions of
cells P::C1, P::C2, and P::C3.<p>

</deflist options>

<defitem initfrom {initfrom <i>page</i> ?<i>page...</i>?}>

Causes the cells on the current page to be initialized from the named
<i>page</i> or pages whenever the current page's cells are to be solved.<p>

Every cell in the model has a default value, as specified by the
<code>-value</code> option when the cell is defined.  When the model
is first loaded or reset, every cell will
have this value.  If a page is solved repeatedly subsequently, each
cell on the page will begin with the value computed the last time.<p>

Sometimes, though, it's desirable to start a page with the values from
some other page or pages.  For example, suppose there are two pages, A
and B.  B uses <iref copypage> to copy A's formulas, and then
modifies a few of them.  The intent is that B should take A's results,
and then modify them.  For this to work, B must not only have A's
formulas; it must also use A's results as its starting point.<p>

<defitem function {function <i>name arglist body</i>}>

Defines a function for use in formulas.  Note that a function is
simply a Tcl <xref tcl:proc(n)> that the formula interpreter sees as
a function.  It can take any number of arguments, and should return a
single value.  The body can contain a small subset of the standard Tcl
commands: <xref tcl:expr(n)>, <xref tcl:set(n)>,
<xref tcl:if(n)>, and <xref tcl:return(n)>.<p>

<defitem index {index <i>name indexlist</i>}>

Defines an index for use with the <iref sum> and <iref prod>
macros.  For example, if you want to sum over cells A.$i where i is in
the set {1 2 3}, you'd define the index <code>i</code> like this:<p>

<pre>
    index i {1 2 3}
</pre>

<defitem forall {forall <i>index script</i>}>

Includes a <i>script</i> of cellmodel(5) commands for all values of
the named <i>index</i>.  For example,<p>

<pre>
    index i {a b c}

    forall i {
        let X.$i = {[Y.$i] + [Z.$i]}
    }
</pre>

The <i>index</i> can also be specified as a pair {<i>ivar index</i>};
in this case, the variable name need not be the same as the index
name.  For example,<p>

<pre>
    index letters {a b c}

    forall {i letters} {
        let X.$i = {[Y.$i] + [Z.$i]}
    }
</pre>


<defitem define {define <i>name arglist</i> ?<i>initbody</i>? <i>template</i>}>

The <iref define> command defines a macro that may be used in
formula definitions.  Macros have names and argument lists, like Tcl
procs, but their body is a <i>template</i> string that can contain variable
references and calls to other macros.  The optional <i>initbody</i>
can compute variables based on the arguments; these variables and the
arguments can appear in the template string.<p>

For example, the following macro returns the formula for the
sum of squares of two variables A.i, given their indices:<p>

<pre>
    define ssq {i j} {[A.$i]**2 + [A.$j]**2}
</pre>

Note that the text in square brackets is <b>not</b> interpolated as a
command; square brackets are reserved for cell value references, which
are evaluated when the model is solved.  Macros, by comparison, are
evaluated when the model is defined.<p>

See <xref MACROS> for more information on how to use macros, and for
a list of predefined macros.<p>

</deflist commands>

<section FUNCTIONS>

Cell model formulas may contain the following functions, in addition
to the standard Tcl <xref tcl:mathfunc(n)> functions; plus, new
functions may be defined using the <iref function> command.<p>

<deflist funcs>

<defitem case {case(<i>condition1,value1,condition2,value2</i>,...)}>

The case() function evaluates all of its arguments.  Then, if
<i>condition1</i> is true (i.e., non-zero) it returns <i>value1</i>;
otherwise, if <i>condition2</i> is true it returns <i>value2</i>; and
so on.  If none of the conditions evaluate to true, the function
returns 0.  For example, <p>

<pre>
    let sign = {
        case([A] <lb>  0, -1,
             [A] == 0,  0,
             [A] <rb>  0,  1)
    }
</pre>

To do an "else" case, use "true" as the condition:<p>

<pre>
    let sign = {
        case([A] <lb>  0, -1,
             [A] == 0,  0,
             true,      1)
    }
</pre>


<defitem epsilon {epsilon()}>

The epsilon() function returns the epsilon value used to control
convergence (the <xref cellmodel(n)> object's <b>-epsilon</b>
option).  It is usually specified as a negative power of 10, i.e.,
.0001; the number of zeroes is then the number of significant digits
in the converged outputs.<p>

<defitem fif {fif(<i>condition, value1,</i> ?<i>value2</i>?)}>

The fif() function evaluates the <i>condition</i>; if it is true, it
returns <i>value1</i> and if not, <i>value2</i>.  If <i>value2</i> is
omitted, it defaults to 0.0.  For example, <p>

<pre>
    let sign = {
        fif([A] <rb>=  0, 1, -1)
    }
</pre>

<defitem format {format(<i>fmt,value,...</i>)}>

Formats the <i>value</i> or values given the <i>fmt</i> string,
just as <xref tcl:format(n)> does.  This can be used in
<b>symbol</b> formulas (see <iref letsym>); it can also be used to
round numeric values to a specified number of decimals places.<p>

<defitem ediff {ediff(<i>a,b</i>)}>

This function computes and returns the difference <i>a - b</i>.  If
the difference is smaller than the the number of significant digits,
as specified by <iref epsilon>, then this function returns 0.0.<p>

</deflist funcs>

<section MACROS>

A cellmodel(5) macro is a command that returns a formula or part of a
formula.  Macros are evaluated when the model is being
loaded.  They are usually used to define multiple formulas
that have the same pattern.  Macros are created using the
<iref define> command.<p>

A macro can be used to create all or part of a cell's formula:<p>

<pre>
    define ssq {i j} {[A.$i]**2 + [A.$j]**2}
    
    let SumOfSquares = [ssq 1 2]              ;#      [A.1]**2 + [A.2]**2
    let TwiceSum     = {2 * (<lb>:ssq 1 2:<rb>)}    ;# 2 * ([A.1]**2 + [A.2]**2)
</pre>

In "SumOfSquares", the macro is called as a normal Tcl command at file
scope.  It simply returns the desired formula.  In "TwiceSum", the
macro is embedded in a formula.  Because square brackets denote cell
references, macros are delimited by "<lb>:" and ":<rb>".  The text returned
by the macro is simply substituted into the formula.<p>

Care is required when using macros.  For example, compare these two
formulas, each using the "ssq" macro defined above:

<pre>
    let Good  = {2*(<lb>:ssq 1 2:<rb>)}    ;# 2*([A.1]**2 + [A.2]**2)
    let Bad   = {2*<lb>:ssq 1 2:<rb>}      ;# 2*[A.1]**2 + [A.2]**2
</pre>

The former is almost certainly what you're looking for; the latter is
almost certainly a mistake.  Consequently, <code>ssq</code> should
probably be defined as follows:<p>

<pre>
    define ssq {i j} {([A.$i]**2 + [A.$j]**2)}
</pre>    


In addition to user-defined macros, cell models may also use the
following:<p>

<deflist macros>

<defitem sum {sum <i>index formula</i>}>

This macro returns a formula that's the sum of <i>formula</i> over the
named <iref index>.  For
example, suppose you have cells A.1, A.2,...,A.5.  Then, the two
following cell definitions are equivalent:<p>

<pre>
    index i {1 2 3 4 5}

    let Sum = {([A.1] + [A.2] + [A.3] + [A.4] + [A.5])}
    let Sum = {<lb>:sum i {[A.$i]}:<rb>}
</pre>

Note the summation formula is parenthesized automatically.<p>

The <i>index</i> can also be specified as a pair {<i>ivar index</i>};
in this case, the variable name need not be the same as the index
name.  For example,<p>

<pre>
    index numbers {1 2 3 4 5}

    let Sum = {<lb>:sum {i numbers} {[A.$i]}:<rb>}
</pre>

<defitem prod {prod <i>index formula</i>}>

This macro returns a formula that's the product of <i>formula</i> over the
named <iref index>.  For
example, suppose you have cells A.1, A.2,...,A.5.  Then, the two
following cell definitions are equivalent:<p>

<pre>
    index i {1 2 3 4 5}

    let Product = {([A.1])*([A.2])*([A.3])*([A.4])*([A.5])}
    let Product = {<lb>:prod i {[A.$i]}:<rb>}
</pre>

Note that the factors are parenthesized automatically.<p>

The <i>index</i> can also be specified as a pair {<i>ivar index</i>};
in this case, the variable name need not be the same as the index
name.  For example,<p>

<pre>
    index numbers {1 2 3 4 5}

    let Product = {<lb>:prod {i numbers} {[A.$i]}:<rb>}
</pre>

</deflist macros>

<section SYNOPSIS>

<pre>
package require marsutil <version>
namespace import ::marsutil::commserver
</pre>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

<xrefset comm(n) comm(n) http://tcllib.sourceforge.net/doc/comm.html>

commserver(n) defines a <xref comm(n)>-based command server;
<xref comm(n)> is a socket-based communications package defined in
Tcllib.<p> 


The commserver(n) object accepts connections from clients at a
specified port, and tracks which clients are connected at any given
time.  Commands sent from the client are passed to an executive object
for processing, and the response (whether a normal result or an error
message) is sent back to the client.  In addition, the application
which contains the commserver can send messages to specific clients or
broadcast them to all clients.<p>

Note that the commserver(n) object doesn't begin to accept
connections immediately on creation; call <iref listen> when
the application is ready to accept connections.<p>

The client connects by sending the command "<tt>connect
<i>name</i></tt>", where <i>name</i> is the client's logical name.
The name and the client's IP address (or "localhost", for local
connections) are passed to the commserver(n)'s <b>-validatecmd</b>,
which must validate the client.  If the client's logical name is
"" (the empty string), then the client's comm(n) ID is used in its
place.<p>

Commands received from connected clients are passed to the
<b>-evalcmd</b> for processing.  Return values and thrown errors are
passed back to the client.<p>

Any Tcl application may be a client by using <xref comm(n)> directly;
however, the <xref commclient(n)> type encapsulates the <xref comm(n)>
code, and provides a safe interpreter for processing messages coming
in from the server.<p>

<section "MESSAGE PROTOCOL">

By default, <xref comm(n)> sends a command as a list of tokens, e.g.,<p>

<pre>
    comm::comm send $port set a 5     ;# Sends "set a 5"
</pre>

commserver(n) expects the command to be sent as a single token, e.g.,<p>

<pre>
    comm::comm send $port {set a 5}   ;# Sends "set a 5"
</pre>


The commands received by the commserver are arbitrary strings; the
executive may process them however it likes.  Typically they will be
formatted as Tcl commands, and the executive will handle them using
a safe Tcl interpreter, but this isn't required.  The executive is
expected to return a result or throw an error in the usual way.<p>

The response to the client is a list of two items:<p>

<pre>
    ok|error &lt;result&gt;
</pre>

If the executive processed the command successfully, then the first
token will be "ok" and the second will the result of calling the
command.<p>

If the executive threw an error, then the first token will be "error"
and the second will be an error message.<p>

Note that <xref commclient(n)> handles this protocol automatically.<p>

<section COMMANDS>

<deflist commands>

<defitem commserver {commserver <i>name ?options?</i>}>

Creates a new commserver(n) object called <i>name</i>. The object is
represented as a new Tcl command in the caller's scope;
<iref commserver> returns the fully-qualified form of the
<i>name</i>.<p>

The <iref commserver> may be created with the following options:<p>

<deflist commserver options>

<defopt {-port <i>portId</i>}>

The <xref comm(n)> port ID at which to receive incoming commands.<p>

This option must be set at creation time, and is read-only
thereafter.<p>

<defopt {-logger <i>name</i>}>

The name of the <xref logger(n)> object to use to log server
activity.<p>

This option must be set at creation time, and is read-only
thereafter.<p>

<defopt {-logcomponent <i>name</i>}>

The component name to pass to the <code>-logger</code> object when
logging messages; defaults to "commserver".<p>

<defopt {-allowremote <i>flag</i>}>

If 0, the default, clients may only connect from the local host.
If 1, connections are accepted from remote hosts as well.<p>

<b>Note:</b> if remote clients are allowed, take care to ensure
that they are properly validated, and that the executive given
to them is suitably constrained!<p>

<defopt {-validatecmd <i>prefix</i>}>

The <i>prefix</i> is a command prefix.  When a new client connects,
its logical name and IP address (or "localhost") will be appended to
<i>prefix</i>, which will then be executed.<p>

The resulting command must validate the logical name and IP address.
It may refuse the connection by throwing an error; otherwise the
connection is presumed to be valid.<p>

If no <b>-validatecmd</b> is supplied, then all connections are
valid.  Note that this is unsafe if <b>-allowremote</b> is enabled.<p>

<defopt {-evalcmd <i>prefix</i>}>

The <i>prefix</i> is a command prefix.  When a connected client
sends a command, the <i>prefix</i> is called as a command with two
additional arguments, the client name and the client's command.
The <b>-evalcmd</b> should evaluate the client's command; any return
value or thrown error are passed back to the client.<p>

<defopt {-connectcmd <i>prefix</i>}>

The <i>prefix</i> is a command prefix.  When a new client connects
and is validated successfully, its logical name and IP address (or
"localhost") will be appended to <i>prefix</i>, which will then be
executed.  Any return value is ignored.<p>

</deflist commserver options>

</deflist commands>

<section "INSTANCE COMMAND">

Each instance of the <iref commserver> object has the following
subcommands:<p>

<deflist instance>

<defitem cget {commserver cget <i>option</i>}>

Returns the value of the specified <i>option</i>.<p>

<defitem configure {$commserver configure <i>option value...</i>}>

Sets the value of one or more of the object's options.<p>

<defitem listen {$commserver listen}>

Call this command when ready for the commserver(n) to accept
connections.<p>

<defitem broadcast {$commserver broadcast <i>script</i>}>

Sends the script to all clients asynchronously, ignoring any reply.
The script will usually be a Tcl command for the client to process
(probably in a safe interpreter), but is in fact an arbitrary text;
the client and server must agree on meaning of such messages.<p>

<defitem send {$commserver send <i>name script</i>}>

Sends the script to the specific client asynchronously, ignoring any
reply.  The <i>name</i> is the client's logical name.
The script will usually be a Tcl command for the client to process
(probably in a safe interpreter), but is in fact an arbitrary text;
the client and server must agree on meaning of such messages.<p>

<defitem clientid {$commserver clientid}>

When the server is processing a client's command, this method returns
the client's <xref comm(n)> ID.<p>

<defitem clientname {$commserver clientname}>

When the server is processing a client's command, this method returns
the client's logical name.<p>

<defitem clients {$commserver clients}>

Returns a list of the logical names of all current clients.<p>

<defitem clientStatus {$commserver clientStatus <i>name</i>}>

Returns the connection status for the client identified by
<i>name</i>.  The return value is "connected" or "disconnected".<p>

<defitem clientTime {$commserver clientTime <i>name</i>}>

Returns the time of last connection/disconnection for the client
identified by <i>name</i>.  The return value is the number of seconds
since the last epoch.  A return value of 0 indicates the client has
never connected.<p>

</deflist instance>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

tabletext(n) is a tool for translating between SQL tables and matching
text files.  At present it can read a text file, validate its content,
and populate SQL tables using the data; at a later time, it may gain
the capability to output SQL tables as text files.<p>

tabletext(n) is used as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> First, an instance of tabletext(n) is created.<p>

  <li> Next, the <iref table> and <iref field> methods are used to
       define the table schemas, and to associate validators with the
       tables and fields.  The chosen table and field names must match
       SQLite table definitions exactly.<p>

  <li> The <iref clear> method can be used to clear old data
       from the SQLite database for the tables known to the
       tabletext(n) instance.<p>

  <li> The <iref loadfile> and <iref load> methods can be used to
       parse input text and populate the SQLite tables.
       
</ul>

<section "BASIC SYNTAX">

A tabletext(n) input file is a text file which defines the contents of
a number of SQL tables.  This section describes the file's syntax,
which is independent of the chosen schema.<p>

The file may contain comments and <b>table</b> statements. A comment
is a line of text beginning with the "#" character:<p>

<pre>
# This is a comment.
</pre>

<subsection "Table Syntax">

A <b>table</b> statement defines the content of a single
database table; each table consists of zero or more records.  The
<b>table</b> statement has this syntax:<p>

<pre>
<b>table</b> <i>tableName</i> {
    <i>record</i>
    <i>record</i>
        .
        .
        .
}
</pre><p>

For example,<p>

<pre>
table employees {
    <i>record</i>
    <i>record</i>
        .
        .
        .
}
</pre>

<subsection "Records and Keys">

The records of each table are identified by the table's key fields.
Each record in the <b>employees</b> table, for example, might be
keyed on the employee's badge number.  Other tables might have
multiple key fields.<p>

Each record is defined by a <b>record</b> statement, which has this syntax:<p>

<pre>
<b>table</b> <i>tableName</i> {
    <b>record</b> <i>keyName</i> <i>keyValue</i> ... {
         <i>field</i>
         <i>field</i>
         .
         .
         .
    }
    .
    .
    .
}
</pre><p>

For example,<p>

<pre>
table employees {
    record badge_number 10034 {
         <i>field</i>
         <i>field</i>
         .
         .
         .
    }

    .
    .
    .
}
</pre>

<subsection "Data Fields">

In addition to its key field or fields, most tables also have one or
more data fields.  Data field values are defined using the <b>field</b>
statement, which has this syntax:<p>

<pre>
<b>table</b> <i>tableName</i> {
    <b>record</b> <i>keyName</i> <i>keyValue</i> ... {
         <b>field</b> <i>fieldName</i> <i>fieldValue</i>
         <b>field</b> <i>fieldName</i> <i>fieldValue</i>
         .
         .
         .
    }
    .
    .
    .
}
</pre>

Field values containing whitespace must be quoted with double
quotes or curly brackets.  By convention, double quotes are used
for short strings and curly brackets for structured values
(e.g., lists) and for text which spills onto more than one line.<p>

For example,<p>

<pre>
table employees {
    record badge_number 10034 {
         field name      "John Doe"
         field mail_stop 144-210
         .
         .
         .
    }

    .
    .
    .
}
</pre>

<section "SCHEMA DEFINITION">

The tabletext(n) schema defines the tables that can appear in the
input, the fields which can appear in those tables, constraints on the
tables and fields, and validation functions to perform additional
validation and consistency checks.

<subsection "Matching the SQL Schema">

In general, the tabletext(n) schema is derived from the SQL schema for
the tables of interest.<p>

For example, the SQL schema for a table of employee records might look
something like this:<p>

<pre>
CREATE TABLE employees (
    badge_number INTEGER       -- The employee's badge number
        PRIMARY KEY,
    name         TEXT,         -- The employee's full name
    mail_stop    TEXT,         -- The employee's mail stop
    .
    .
    .
);
</pre>

The matching tabletext(n) schema must use the same table and field names:<p>

<pre>
set tt [tabletext %AUTO%]

$tt table employees
$tt field employees badge_number -key
$tt field employees name
$tt field employees mail_stop
</pre>

The "$tt" object can now be used to parse employee data from a file
with the syntax shown in <xref "BASIC SYNTAX">.  However, little
validation is done, beyond ensuring that the badge number is unique
for each employee.<p>

<subsection "Required Fields">

There are several options which can be used to constrain field values.
For example, the employee's name is a required field, and we'd like it
to be unique.  We can specify that as follows:<p>

<pre>
$tt field employees name -required -unique
</pre>

<subsection "Default Values">

Some fields may have default values.  These are usually entered in
the SQL schema; then, a record which does not explicitly specify a
value for that field will get the default value.<p>

For example, suppose that most employees share a single mail stop:<p>

<pre>
CREATE TABLE employees (
    badge_number INTEGER       -- The employee's badge number
        PRIMARY KEY,
    name         TEXT,         -- The employee's full name
    mail_stop    TEXT          -- The employee's mail stop
        DEFAULT '144-210',
    .
    .
    .
);
</pre>

<subsection "Field Validators">

You can also specify a field validator, a function which will ensure
that the field's value is valid.  For example, badge numbers must not
only be unique; they must also be five-digit integers, possibly
with leading zeros.  Field validators are Tcl commands which expect
three arguments: the name of the SQLite database object, the name of
the current table, and the field value.  A validator has two jobs:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Throw an error if the value is invalid.
  <li> Return the value in canonical form.
</ul><p>

For example, a badge number validator might look like this:<p>

<pre>
proc BadgeValidator {db table value} {
    # FIRST, validate the value and throw an error if it is invalid
    require {[string is integer -strict $value]} \
        "Value is not an integer: \"$value\""

    # NEXT, put it in canonical form
    return [format "%05d" $value]
}
</pre>

You'd add this validator to the schema as follows:<p>

<pre>
$tt field employees badge_number -key \
    -validator BadgeValidator
</pre>

<subsection "Table and Record Validation">

Similarly, you can define table and record validators as options on
the <iref table> method, and you can specify that one table depends
on one or more other tables.  A record validator is a proc that is
called after each record is defined; it can check cross-field
constraints.  A table validator is a proc that is called after the
table is defined; it can check cross-record constraints and even
insert additional records into the database.<p>

<section COMMANDS>

<deflist commands>

<defitem tabletext {tabletext <i>name ?options?</i>}>

Creates a new tabletext(n) object called <i>name</i>. The object is
represented as a new Tcl command in the caller's scope;
<iref tabletext> returns the fully-qualified form of the
<i>name</i>.<p>

</deflist commands>

<section "INSTANCE COMMAND">

Each instance of the <iref tabletext> object has the following subcommands:<p>

<deflist instance>

<defitem table {$tt table <i>name</i> ?<i>options...</i>?}>

Adds a table called <i>name</i> to the schema.  The call may include
the following validation options:<p>

<deflist table options>

<defopt {-tablevalidator cmd}>

Defines a command to be called after all of the table's records have
been defined.  If the table does not appear in the input, the
validator will be called after all input has been read.  The validator
can check cross-record constraints, add records to the table, and so
forth.  If it detects a problem, it should throw an error.<p>

<i>cmd</i> is a command prefix to which two arguments will be added,
the name of the SQLite database object, and the name of the table.
Any return value is ignored.<p>

<defopt {-recordvalidator <i>cmd</i>}>

Defines a command to be called after each record is read from the
input and added to the SQL table, to check cross-field constraints.
If the command detects a problem, it should throw an error.
Any return value is ignored.<p>

<i>cmd</i> is a command prefix to which three arguments will be added,
the name of the SQLite database object, the name of the table, and
the "ROWID" of the record in the SQL table.  The "ROWID" is used to
retrieve the record data, i.e.,

<pre>
proc MyRecordValidator {db table rowid} {
    $db eval "SELECT * FROM $table WHERE ROWID=\$rowid" row {
        # Validate the constraints
        .
        .
        .
    }
}
</pre>

<defopt {-dependson <i>list</i>}>

This option is used to specify that the table depends on one or more
other tables; <i>list</i> is a list of their names.  If this table
appears in the input before any of the listed tables, an error is
thrown.<p>

</deflist table options>

<defitem field {$tt field <i>table field</i> ?<i>options...</i>?}>

This method defines a new field for a previously defined table.
<i>table</i> is the table name, and <i>field</i> is the field name;
these must match the names in the SQLite database schema.  The options
are used to define additional validation constraints.<p>

<deflist field options>

<defopt {-key}>

This field is (a component of) the primary key.  Taken together, the
values of the fields marked as <code>-key</code>'s must be unique for
each record.<p>

<defopt {-unique}>

Each record must have a unique value for this field.  This option is
used only for data fields; keys are unique by definition.<p>

<defopt {-required}>

Each record in the input must explicitly specify a value for this
field; there is no default value.<p>

<defopt {-validator <i>cmd</i>}>

Defines a field validator.  The validator is called for each
"field" statement in the input; see <xref "Field Validators"> for an
example.<p>

<i>cmd</i> is a command prefix to which three arguments will be added:
the name of the SQLite database object, the table name, and the value
to validate.  The command must:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Throw an error if the value is invalid.<p>

  <li> Return the value in canonical form (however the application
       defines that).  For example, <xref enum(n)> values can be
       expressed case-insensitively using short names, long names, or
       index numbers; the database usually contains the short
       name with the precise case used in the enum definition.<p>
</ul>

<defopt {-default}>

This is the default value for the field.  If the text does not specify
a field value, this value will be used instead.<p>

</deflist field options>

<defitem clear {$tt clear <i>db</i>}>

Deletes all records from known tables in SQLite database <i>db</i>.
The table schema, at least, must already be defined in <i>db</i>, as
tabletext(n) doesn't know the SQL schema.  SQLite tables not included
in the tabletext(n) schema will not be touched.<p>

<defitem {get default} {$tt get default <i>table field</i>}>

Returns the -default value for the specified field.
The empty string will be returned if -default was not specified with
<iref field>.<p>

<defitem loadfile {$tt loadfile <i>db dbfile</i> ?<i>preamble</i>?}>

Reads input text from a file named <i>dbfile</i>, parses it, and loads
the data into tables in SQLite database <i>db</i>.  The SQLite tables
are <iref clear>ed first.<p>

If the <i>preamble</i> is specified, it contains text that is parsed
before the text in the <i>dbfile</i>.<p>

<defitem load {$tt load <i>db dbtext</i> ?<i>preamble</i>?}>

This method is identical to <iref loadfile>, except that the input
text is read from the string <i>dbtext</i>, rather than from a
file.<p>

<defitem validate {$tt validate <i>subcommand</i> ?<i>args</i>? db table value</i>}>

These methods are for use as field <b>-validator</b> commands. Each one may
have arguments which proceed the standard <i>db</i>, <i>table</i>, and
<i>value</i> arguments; these are specified by the schema as part of the
<b>-validator</b>.<p>

<deflist validate>


<defitem "validate vtype" {$tt validate vtype <i>vtype db table value</i>}>

Validates a field given a validation type object.  The <i>vtype</i>
must have a <b>validate</b> subcommand that takes one argument, the value
to validate, and returns the value if valid and throws an error otherwise.
Ideally, the <b>validate</b> subcommand should throw error code
<b>INVALID</b>.<p>

<defitem "validate foreign" {$tt validate foreign <i>otherTable field db table value</i>}>

Verifies that the value being validated appears in the <i>field</i> column
in some record in the <i>otherTable</i>.<p>

</deflist validate>

<defitem writefile {$tt writefile <i>db outfile infile</i>}>

Writes the contents of tables, records and fields back out to a file specified
as <i>outfile</i>. The supplied database object <i>db</i> is used as the source
of the data. <i>infile</i> is the name of the file used to initially populate
<i>db</i> and is written to <i>outfile</i>'s header.<p>

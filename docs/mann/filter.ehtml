<section SYNOPSIS>

<pre>
package require marsgui <version>
namespace import ::marsgui::*
</pre>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

This widget provides a text filter control for doing exact, wildcard
and regular expression-based filtering, both inclusive and exclusive,
of arbitrary text.  The widget contains a sieve icon which pops up a
menu, an entry field (with command history) for typing filter text,
and a clear button.

Filtering is triggered when <lb>Return<rb> is pressed in
the entry field, when the field is cleared, and when the search type
and inclusive/exclusive match flag is set.  When filtering is
triggered, the client's <code>-filtercmd</code> is called.  The
<code>-filtercmd</code> will typically pass one or more snippets of
text to the <iref check> method, and display them or not depending
on the result.

<subsection "The Sieve Icon Menu">

The first set of entries on the menu allows the user to select the
type of the filter text:

<ul>
  <li> <b>Exact</b>  -- An arbitrary text string
  <li> <b>Incremental</b> -- An arbitrary text string, matched
       incrementally as the user enters each character.
  <li> <b>Wildcard</b>  -- A string containing wildcard characters,
       e.g., "*"
  <li> <b>Regexp</b> -- A regular expression
</ul>

The second set is a single flag, <b>Ignore Case</b>.

The third set indicates whether filtration is inclusive or exclusive:

<ul>
  <li> <b>Include Matches</b> -- data items which match the filter
       text pass the filter.
  <li> <b>Exclude Matches</b> -- data items which do <i>not</i> match
       the filter text pass the filter.
</ul>

<section COMMANDS>

This module defines the following command:

<deflist commands>

<defitem filter {filter <i>pathName ?options...?</i>}>

Creates a new <iref filter> widget named <i>pathName</i>.

The <iref filter> widget may be created with all the standard Tk frame
widget options, plus the following filter(n)-specific options:

<deflist filter options>

<defopt {-width <i>chars</i>}>

Specifies the character width of the filter(n)'s entry field.
Defaults to 20.

<defopt {-filtercmd <i>cmd</i>}>

Specifies a command to be called whenever filtration is triggered; the
command can do anything at all, but will usually use
<iref check> to filter one or more snippets of text.

The <code>-filtercmd</code> will be called when <lb>Return<rb> is pressed
in the widget's text field, when any character is pressed (in
<b>incremental</b> mode), when the text field is cleared, when
an option is changed on <xref "The Sieve Icon Menu">, and when the
<code>-filtertype</code> or <code>-ignorecase</code> options are
changed by the application.

<defopt {-filtertype <i>value</i>}>

Explicitly sets the filter type to one of <b>exact</b> (the default),
<b>incremental</b>, <b>wildcard</b>, or <b>regexp</b>, and calls the <code>-filtercmd</code>.

<defopt {-ignorecase <i>flag</i>}>

Explicitly sets the ignore case <i>flag</i> (the default is false),
and calls the <code>-filtercmd</code>.

<defopt {-msgcmd <i>cmd</i>}>

A command for reporting messages to the user; if defined, <i>cmd</i>
will be called with a message appended to it as a single argument
whenever filter(n) wishes to report a message.

</deflist filter options>

</deflist commands>

<section "INSTANCE COMMAND">

<deflist instance>

<defitem check {$filter check <i>string</i>}>

Checks the <i>string</i> against the current filter text and settings,
and returns 1 if the <i>string</i> passes the filter and 0 otherwise.

</deflist>

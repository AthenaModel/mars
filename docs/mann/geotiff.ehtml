<section SYNOPSIS>

<pre>
package require marsutil <version>
namespace import ::marsutil::*
</pre>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

geotiff(n) defines a type that can be used to read and return
pertinent geo-referencing information from a GeoTIFF file.
This operation is implemented in C and is available only in the
optional Marsbin library extension.
NOTE: a complete description of the GeoTIFF specification is beyond the scope
of this document. See 
<link http://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff "the GeoTIFF spec"> for more.

<section COMMANDS>

<deflist>

<defitem "geotiff read" {geotiff read <i>filename</i>}>

Given the name of a GeoTIFF file, reads pertinent geo-reference information
from it and returns the data in the form of a dict. The only supported
GeoTIFF model type is <b>GEOGRAPHIC</b> and the following data is returned:

<ul>
  <li> <code>modeltype</code> - the model type; <code>GEOGRAPHIC</code>
  <li> <code>tiepoints</code> - list of six doubles: the first three are
                   the x,y and z coords in raster space that the following
                   three lat/long/altitude values are tied to.
  <li> <code>pscale</code>    - list of three doubles: the scaling in the
                   x,y and z directions that each pixel has in map coords
</ul>

<b>NOTE:</b> The z-coordinate and altitude values are, according to the
GeoTIFF specification, provided in anticipation of future support for
3D digital elevation models. As such, those are normally set to zero and
only 2-dimensional space is considered.

These model types are not yet supported:

<ul>
  <li> <b>GEOCENTRIC</b>
  <li> <b>PROJECTED</b>
</ul>

<section EXAMPLES>

Say a call to  <code>geotiff read</code>  returns the following dictionary:
<code>modeltype GEOGRAPHIC tiepoints {0.0 0.0 0.0 52.254312 87.31243 0.0} 
pscale {0.000543 0.000543 0.0}</code>

This means that the TIFF image has its upper-left corner (tie point 
0.0, 0.0) tied to a decimal lat/long pair of 52.254312, 87.31243 and that the
latitude and longitude values increase by 0.000543 decimal degrees for each
pixel in the image.

<section ENVIRONMENT>

geotiff(n) requires the Marsbin extension.

To use geotiff(n) in a Tcl script, the environment variable
<code>TCLLIBPATH</code> must include the parent of the marsutil(n)
library directory.

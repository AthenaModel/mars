<manpage {marsgui(n) multifield(n)} "Multi-Select Label Field">

<section SYNOPSIS>

<pre>
package require marsgui <version>
namespace import ::marsgui::*
</pre>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

The multifield(n) widget is a pseudo-field which adheres to the
<xref field(i)> interface.  It has a value, and <iref set> and
<iref get> methods, but the user cannot directly edit this value.<p>

It is used for dialogs which will update a collection of two or more
selected entities; its value is a list of the IDs of the entities.  It
displays a label that says "<b><i>num</i> Selected</b>", where
<i>num</i> is the number of entries in the list.<p>

<section COMMANDS>

This module defines the following commands.<p>

<deflist commands>

<defitem multifield {multifield <i>pathName</i> ?<i>options...</i>?}>

Creates a new <iref multifield> widget named <i>pathName</i>, and
returns <i>pathName</i>.  The widget supports the following options:<p>

<defopt {-changecmd <i>command</i>}>

From <xref field(i)>.  Specifies a <i>command</i> to be called
whenever the field's value changes due to explicit calls to
<iref set>.The new value is appended to the <i>command</i> as an argument.<p>

<defopt {-state <i>state</i>}>

From <xref field(i)>.  <xref field(i)> widgets have states, just as the
normal <code>tk::</code> and <code>ttk::</code> widgets do.  The valid
states are <b>normal</b> and <b>disabled</b>.<p>

<defopt {-table <i>table</i>}>

The name of the RDB table with which the multifield is associated.
Note that the widget itself doesn't use this value, but it can be
queried by clients.<p>

<defopt {-key <i>name</i>}>

The name of the key column in the <code>-table</code> from which the
IDs are drawn.  Note that the widget itself doesn't use this value,
but it can be queried by clients.<p>

</deflist commands>

<section "INSTANCE COMMAND">

multifield(n) widgets have the following subcommands:<p>

<deflist instance>

<defitem cget {<i>pathName</i> cget <i>option</i>}>

From <xref field(i)>.  Returns the value of the specified <i>option</i>.<p>

<defitem configure {<i>pathName</i> configure <i>option value...</i>}>

From <xref field(i)>.  Sets the value of one or more of the object's
options.<p>

<defitem get {<i>pathName</i> get}>

From <xref field(i)>.  Returns the field's current value.<p>

<defitem set {<i>pathName</i> set <i>value</i>}>

From <xref field(i)>.  Explicitly sets the field's <i>value</i>, and
calls the <code>-changecmd</code> if the value has really changed,
i.e., successive calls to <iref set> with the same <i>value</i> will
result in at most one call to the <code>-changecmd</code>.<p>

</deflist instance>

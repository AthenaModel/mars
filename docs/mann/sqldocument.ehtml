<section DESCRIPTION>

<xref sqldocument(n)> is a Tcl wrapper around SQLite3 database
objects.  It provides access to all features of an SQLite3 database
object; in addition:<p>

<ul>
  <li> By default, sqldocument(n) implements a commit-on-demand policy.
       That is, updates to the database are accumulated until an
       explicit commit is requested, instead of being committed
       immediately.  This improves performance when many independent
       transactions are done in rapid succession, at the expense of
       concurrent access (which JNEM does not need).  This behavior
       is controlled by the <code>-autotrans</code> option.<p>

  <li> By default, sqldocument(n) disables SQLite3's rollback
       capability, resulting in a performance gain.  If the ability to
       roll back transactions is required, set <code>-rollback</code>
       to "on".<p>

  <li> Checking of foreign key constraints is enabled automatically
       (<b>PRAGMA foreign_keys=on;</b>).  To disable foreign keys,
       set <code>-foreignkeys</code> to "off".<p>

  <li> Modules which adhere to the <xref sqlsection(i)> interface
       can be registered with an instance of <xref sqldocument(n)>,
       thus including their schema and function definitions in all
       databases subsequently created using that instance.<p>

  <li> A number of useful operations from <xref sqlib(n)> are
       provided as subcommands.<p>
</ul>

<b>NOTE:</b> The SQLite3 database file is closed when the
sqldocument(n) object is destroyed--but updates are not committed.
Call <iref close> explicitly!<p>

<section "SCHEMA">

At present, sqldocument(n) adds no definitions of its own to the database
schema; if it did, they would appear here.<p>

<pre>
<fromproject {::marsutil::sqldocument sqlsection schema}>
</pre>

<section "SQL FUNCTIONS">

sqldocument(n) defines the following standard SQL functions, which
may be used in addition to those defined by SQLite3:<p>

<deflist sql_functions>

<defitem dicteq {dicteq(<i>dict</i>,<i>key</i>,<i>value</i>,...)}>

This function maps to the <xref marsmisc(n) dicteq> command.  It is
useful for doing queries against a column whose value is a Tcl
dictionary.<p>

<defitem dictget {dictget(<i>dict</i>,<i>key</i>)}>

This function retrieves the <i>key</i>'s value from the <i>dict</i>,
or the empty string if the <i>key</i> is not found.  It is
useful for doing queries against a column whose value is a Tcl
dictionary.<p>

<defitem dictglob {dictglob(<i>dict</i>,<i>key</i>,<i>pattern</i>,...)}>

This function maps to the <xref marsmisc(n) dictglob> command.  It is
useful for doing queries against a column whose value is a Tcl
dictionary.<p>

<defitem error {error(<i>errmsg</i>,...)}>

This function maps to the standard Tcl <code>error(n)</code> command.
It's useful for throwing errors in queries (e.g., in lock triggers).<p>

<defitem format {format(<i>fmtstring</i>, <i>args...</i>)}>

This function maps to the standard Tcl <code>format(n)</code> command.
It's useful for formatting retrieved values during queries.  For
example,<p>

<pre>
  $db query {
     SELECT id,format('%5.1f',magnitude) FROM nsat_levels
  }
</pre><p>

<defitem joinlist {joinlist(<i>list</i>, <i>delimiter</i>)}>

This function maps to the standard Tcl <code>join(n)</code> command.
It's useful for formatting list-valued database columns.  For example,

<pre>
  $db query {
     SELECT FED_ID,joinlist(DETAILS, ', ') FROM absits
  }
</pre><p>

<defitem nonempty {nonempty(<i>arg</i>,...)}>

Returns the value of the first argument which is neither NULL nor the
empty string, or the empty string if no argument is non-empty.  This
is a Tcl-friendly equivalent to COALESCE() which treats empty strings
like NULLs.<p>

<defitem now {now(?<i>offset</i>?)}>

If <code>-clock</code> is specified, then <iref now> will be
defined, and will return the current simulation time in ticks.  If
<i>offset</i> is given, it's an offset in integer ticks; it will be
added to the current simulation time, and returned.<p>

<defitem percent {percent(<i>frac</i>)}>
Displays the fraction as a percentage.  If the fraction
is at least 0.005, displays it as an integer percentage, e.g.,
1%, 10%, 25%.  If the fraction is <lb>= 0.005 but greater than
0.0, displays it as "~0%".
<p>

<defitem timestr {timestr(<i>ticks</i>, ?<i>offset</i>?)}>
<defitem tozulu {tozulu(<i>ticks</i>, ?<i>offset</i>?)}>

If <code>-clock</code> is specified, then <iref timestr> and
<iref tozulu> will be
defined.  Given a simulation time as <i>ticks</i> plus an optional
<i>offset</i>, returns the resulting simulation time as a
human-readable time string; the format depends on the particular
<xref simclock(i)> object assigned to <code>-clock</code>.<p>

<b>Note: The <iref tozulu> form is deprecated.</b>

<defitem wallclock {wallclock()}>

Returns the wall-clock time in Unix seconds.<p>

</deflist sql_functions>

<section "COLLATING SEQUENCES">

This module defines the following additional collation sequences for
use when defining or querying database tables:<p>

<deflist collations>

<defitem DICT {DICT}>

The <b>DICT</b> collating sequence causes a column to be sorted in
dictionary order, as defined by the <xref tcl:lsort(n)> command's
<b>-dictionary</b> option.  This is useful for columns that contain
an embedded number, as it makes "N10" sort after "N9" rather than
between "N1" and "N2".<p>

This collating sequence should be used sparingly, as its
implementation is rather slow.<p>

</deflist collations>

<section COMMANDS>

This module defines the following command:<p>

<deflist commands>

<defitem sqldocument {sqldocument <i>name</i> ?<i>option value...</i>?}>

Creates a new <iref sqldocument> object named <i>name</i>. The object is
represented as a new Tcl command in the caller's scope;
<iref sqldocument> returns the fully-qualified form of the
<i>name</i>.<p>

After the object is created, a database file must still
be <iref open>ed, and (if so desired) it must also be
<iref clear>ed.<p>

The object may be created with the following options:<p>

<deflist options>

<defopt {-autotrans <i>boolean</i>}>

If <b>on</b>, the default, the sqldocument(n) always has an open
transaction; changes are not committed until <iref commit> is
called.  If <b>off</b>, the application can batch queries into
transactions as it chooses, and <iref commit> has no effect.<p>

<defopt {-clock <i>simclock</i>}>

<b>Readonly.</b> The <i>simclock</i> must be a <xref simclock(i)>
object.  If this option is given, the <iref now> and
<iref timestr> SQL functions will be defined.<p>

<defopt {-commitcmd <i>command</i>}>

If specified, this command is called after the database is committed but 
before a new transaction is begun. This is most useful when the
<b>-autotrans</b> option is <b>on</b> since it gives the ability to perform
some task while the database is not locked due to an open transaction.
<p>

<defopt {-explaincmd <i>command</i>}>

If specified, the <i>command</i> is a command prefix to be called by 
<iref explain> with two additional arguments: the query, and the
result of using SQLite's "EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN" on the query.<p>

<defopt {-foreignkeys <i>boolean</i>}>

Explicitly enables or disables foreign key checking, according to the
value of the <i>boolean</i> flag.  Foreign key checking is
<b>on</b> by default.  See <b>PRAGMA foreign_keys</b> in the SQLite3
documentation for more information.<p>

<defopt {-readonly <i>boolean</i>}>

If <b>yes</b>, the sqldocument(n) object can be used to read an existing
database, but cannot change it in any way; any attempt to write to it
will throw an error.<p>

<defopt {-rollback <i>boolean</i>}>

If <b>on</b>, transactions can be rolled back instead of committed.
If <b>off</b>, the default, they cannot.<p>

<defopt {-subject <i>name</i>}>

The sqldocument(n) will send out <xref notifier(n)> events when the
<iref monitor> API is used.  By default, the instance name is used
as the subject of the events.  If this option's value is not empty,
it is used as the subject instead.  This is useful when
the sqldocument(n) is wrapped by another object, as is frequently the
case.  The appropriate subject is then the wrapper rather than the
sqldocument(n) itself.<p>

</deflist options>

<defitem {sqldocument sqlsection} {sqldocument sqlsection <i>subcommand</i>}>

sqldocument(n) is itself an <xref sqlsection(i)>, as it defines
schema entities (see <xref SCHEMA>) and SQL functions (see
<xref "SQL FUNCTIONS">).  See <xref sqlsection(i)> for a description
of this method's subcommands.<p>

sqldocument(n) is the only sqlsection(i) registered automatically with
all instances.<p>

</deflist commands>

<section "INSTANCE COMMAND">

The created sqldocument(n) object has the following subcommands; in
addition, it supports all of the methods of an SQLite3 database
object (except as overridden here).<p>

<deflist instance>

<defitem clear {$db clear}>

Initializes the contents of the database, deleting any existing
data and re-defining the schema.<p>

<defitem close {$db close}>

Closes the database, first committing any updates.  The database
cannot be accessed again unless it is first <iref open>ed
explicitly.<p>

<defitem commit {$db commit}>

Saves all pending updates.  If <code>-autotrans</code> is off, this
command has no effect.<p>

<defitem dbfile {$db dbfile}>

Returns the name of the last-opened database file, or "" if none.<p>

<defitem delete {$db delete ?-grab? <i>table condition</i> ?<i>table condition</i>...?}>

Deletes the rows from each <i>table</i> that match the associated
<i>condition</i>, where <i>condition</i> is a boolean SQL expression
that may include variable references.  If the <code>-grab</code>
option is included, the call returns a <iref grab> data set of all
of the deleted rows, including those from cascading and triggered
deletes; the table specifications in the dataset include the "INSERT"
tag, so that <iref ungrab> will use INSERT rather than UPDATE to
insert the rows into the database.<p>

With <code>-grab</code>, the command is intended to capture deleted
row data so that cascading and triggered
deletes can be easily undone using <iref ungrab>.  For example,<p>

<pre>
    # Delete an entry, plus cascading deletes, and save the undo data.
    set data [$db delete -grab table1 {id=$id}]
    ...
    # Undo the deletion, restoring all deleted data.
    $db ungrab $data
</pre>

Note that this command does not support <iref grab>'s
<code>-tcl</code> option.<p>

<defitem eval {$db eval <i>query</i> ?<i>args...</i>?}>

This is simply the standard SQLite3 "eval" subcommand.  See the
SQLite3 documentation for details.<p>

<defitem explain {$db explain <i>query</i> ?<i>args...</i>?}>

The <iref explain> method is intended to function identically to 
SQLite's standard <iref eval> method, except that it will run
"EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN" on the query and call the
<code>-explaincmd</code> prior to actually executing the query.<p>

This feature is for use by the developer as an aid to improving
performance: set the <code>-explaincmd</code> when creating the
instance of <iref sqldocument>; then, in order to tune a
particular query, replace the call to <iref eval> with a call to
<iref explain>.  When optimization is complete, replace
<iref explain> with <iref eval> once again.<p>

<defitem fklist {$db fklist <i>table</i> ?-indirect?}>

Returns a list of the tables with foreign keys that reference the
specified <i>table</i>, excluding <i>table</i> itself.  If the
<code>-indirect</code> option is included, the list also includes the
tables that depend indirectly on <i>table</i>.  It is an error if
<i>table</i> is unknown.<p>

<defitem grab {$db grab ?-insert? <i>table condition</i> ?<i>table condition...</i>?}>

Grabs a collection of rows from one or more tables in the 
database, and returns them to the user as one value.  The grabbed data
can later be restored to the database using <iref ungrab>.
For example, an operation that updates rows in the database might
grab the rows prior to the change so that the original values can
be restored afterwards.<p>

The returned value is called a "grab data set".  It is a flat list
structure {<i>tableSpec values tableSpec values...</i>} where
<i>tableSpec</i> identifies the table and <i>values</i> is a flat list of
column values for all of the grabbed rows from the table.  As returned
by <iref grab>, the <i>tableSpec</i> is simply the name of the
table; if the optional <code>-insert</code> option is included, 
however, it will be a list {<i>tableName</i> INSERT}.  The
INSERT tag tells <iref ungrab> to use INSERT to put the data
in the table rather than UPDATE.<p>

NULL values are retrieved as the SQLite3 "nullvalue", which defaults
to the empty string.<p>

For example,<p>

<pre>
    set data [$db grab table1 {x=5} table2 {y=10}]
</pre>

will grab all rows from table1 where x = 5, and all rows from
table2 where y = 10.<p>

The result of calling <iref grab> can be passed to
the <iref ungrab> command to put the rows
back in the database.<p>

<defitem insert {$db insert <i>table dict</i>}>

Inserts the contents of dictionary <i>dict</i> into the database as a
row in the named <i>table</i>.  The dictionary keys must be the same
as the column names in the table.  <b>It's an error if a row already
exists with the same key column values.</b><p>

This will be less efficient than an explicit "INSERT INTO" with
hardcoded column names, but where performance isn't an issue it wins
on maintainability.<p>

Compare to <iref replace>.<p>

<defitem islocked {$db islocked <i>table</i>}>

Returns 1 if the named table exists and is <iref lock>ed, and 0
otherwise.<p>

<defitem isopen {$db isopen}>

Returns 1 if a database file is open, and 0 otherwise.<p>

<defitem lock {$db lock <i>tables</i>}>

Locks one more database tables, where <i>tables</i> is a list of the
table names.  Locked tables are effectively read-only; attempts to
update, insert, or delete rows will fail until the table
is <iref unlock>ed again.  Note that locked tables can
still be dropped in their entirety.<p>

The tables to be locked must exist, and may be either persistent or
temporary.  Note that tables in "attached" databases cannot be locked
using this mechanism.<p>

Locking a table that is already locked is <b>not</b> an error; the table
simply remains locked.<p>

<defitem mat {$db mat <i>table iname jname ename</i> ?<i>options...</i>?}>

Extracts a <xref mat(n)> matrix from the database; the arguments and
options are as for <xref sqlib(n)>'s <xref sqlib(n) "sqlib mat"> method.<p>

<defitem monitor {$db monitor <i>subcommand</i> ?<i>args...</i>?}>

The <iref monitor> family of commands is used to monitor changes to
RDB tables, row by row.  The subcommands are as follows:<p>

<deflist monitor>

<defitem "monitor add" {$db monitor add <i>table keynames</i>}>

Requests monitoring of the specified <i>table</i>.  The
<i>keynames</i> argument should a list of one or more column names;
these are the columns used to identify the modified rows.<p>

<defitem "monitor remove" {$db monitor remove <i>table</i>}>

Disables monitoring for the specified <i>table</i>.<p>

<defitem "monitor script" {$db monitor script <i>body</i>}>

This command executes <i>body</i> as a Tcl script, while monitoring
changes to all monitored tables. Before <i>body</i> is executed,
monitoring is enabled for all of the requested tables; after <i>body</i> is
executed, a <xref notifier(n)> event is sent for every
monitored database row that changed, and monitoring is disabled
again.  Note that monitoring is disabled and notifications are
sent even if <i>body</i> throws an error.<p>

Each notifier event will have the scenariodb(n) object as its
subject and the table name (quoted in angle brackets) as its event.
The event will have two arguments: the operation (<b>update</b> or
<b>delete</b>) and a key value indicating the row that changed.<p>

For example, if the <b>rel_fg</b> table is monitored and the
relationship for group G1's relationship with G2 is modified, the
following event will be sent:<p>

<pre>
    notifier send $db <lb>rel_fg<rb> update {G1 G2}
</pre>

Note the the operation is <b>update</b> even when a new record is
added.  In practice, both new records and updated records are handled
much the same way by the GUI, and it is difficult to get SQLite3 to be
precise about whether a change is an addition or an update.  (SQLite3
can distinguish clearly between an INSERT statement and an UPDATE
statement; but an INSERT OR REPLACE can do either an insert or
an update, and there's no easy way to tell which.)<p>

In addition, if at least one <b>update</b> or <b>delete</b> event has
been sent, the database will also send one final event:<p>

<pre>
    notifier send $db <lb>Monitor<rb>
</pre>

Calls to <iref monitor script> and <iref monitor transaction>
can be nested.<p>

<defitem "monitor transaction" {$db monitor transaction <i>body</i>}>

This command is essentially the same as <iref monitor script>,
except that it executes <i>body</i> in the context of an
SQL transaction, using SQLite3's "transaction" subcommand.<p>

Calls to <iref monitor transaction> and <iref monitor script>
can be nested.<p>

</deflist monitor>

<defitem open {$db open ?<i>filename</i>?}>

Opens (but does not <iref clear>) a database file with the specified
<i>filename</i>.  If <i>filename</i> is missing, <iref open> will
re-open the previously-opened database file, if any.<p>

Call <iref clear> explicitly to initialize the database.<p>

All temporary schema definitions and all SQL function definitions from
all registered <xref sqlsection(i)> modules will be defined in
the database as soon as it is <iref open>ed.  The persistent schema
definitions will be not be defined in a newly created database until
it is <iref clear>ed.</i>

<defitem query {$db query <i>sql</i> ?<i>options...</i>?}>

Queries the database and returns the results formatted for
display.  The options are as for <xref sqlib(n)>'s
<xref sqlib(n) query> method.<p>

<b>Note:</b> use "eval", provided by the underlying SQLite object, for
programmatic queries.<p>

<defitem register {$db register <i>section</i>}>

Registers an <xref sqlsection(i)> module with this instance, where
<i>section</i> is the fully-qualified name of the module.  Once
registered, the <i>section</i>'s definitions will be included as
appropriate on <iref open> and <iref clear>.<p>

<defitem replace {$db replace <i>table dict</i>}>

Inserts the contents of dictionary <i>dict</i> into the database as a
row in the named <i>table</i>.  The dictionary keys must be the same
as the column names in the table.  <b>If there's already a row with
matching key columns, it will be replaced.</b><p>

This will be less efficient than an explicit "INSERT OR REPLACE INTO" with
hardcoded column names, but where performance isn't an issue it wins
on maintainability.<p>

Compare to <iref insert>.<p>

<defitem safeeval {$db safeeval <i>args...</i>}>

This subcommand is just like "eval", but is
prevented from changing the contents of the database.  It is
intended for use in commands accessible to the user of the
application.<p>

<defitem safequery {$db safequery <i>args...</i>}>

This subcommand is just like <iref query>, but is
prevented from changing the contents of the database; also,
the query cannot include variables.<p>

<defitem saveas {$db saveas <i>filename</i>}>

Saves a copy of the persistent contents of the database to a new
database file called <i>filename</i>.  It's an error if there is
already a file with that <i>filename</i>.<p>

<defitem schema {$db schema ?<i>table</i>?}>

Returns the SQL schema for the specified <i>table</i>, or for the
database as a whole.  The output includes both persistent and
temporary definitions.  The <i>table</i> may contain wildcards.<p>

<defitem sections {$db sections}>

Returns a list of the names of the <xref sqlsection(i)>
modules registered with this instance.<p>

<defitem tables {$db tables}>

Returns the names of the tables defined in the current database,
including temporary tables and tables defined in attached
databases.<p>

<defitem ungrab {$db ungrab <i>data</i>}>

Given a "grab data set" produced by <iref grab> or <iref delete>,
this command puts the data back into the database using either UPDATE
or INSERT, as determined by the optional INSERT tag in each table's
specification in the data set.  For example, the following code grabs
rows from the database, modifies them, and then restores the original
values.<p>

<pre>
    set data [$db grab table1 {x=5} table2 {y=10}]
    ...
    # Code that updates the grabbed rows.
    ...
    $db ungrab $data
</pre>

If the INSERT tag is included in a table spec, this command
can also be used to re-insert deleted rows.<p>

Note that the schemas of the relevant tables should not be altered
between grabbing and ungrabbing, or the ungrabbing will have
unpredictable results.<p>

Whether updating or inserting, values that match the 
SQLite3 "nullvalue" will be inserted as NULL.  When updating, however,
it is assumed that key columns do not contain NULL.<p>

<defitem unlock {$db unlock <i>tables</i>}>

Unlocks one more <iref lock>ed database tables, where <i>tables</i>
is a list of the table names.  Once unlocked, the tables are
once again read-write, and rows can be updated, inserted, or deleted.<p>

Unlocking a table that isn't locked is <b>not</b> an error; the table
simply remains unlocked.<p>

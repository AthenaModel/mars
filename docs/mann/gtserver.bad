<section SYNOPSIS>

<pre>
package require util 1.0
namespace import ::marsutil::gtserver
</pre>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

gtserver(n) defines an API for publishing game truth variables to
any number of <xref commclient(n)> objects via a
<xref commserver(n)> object.<p>  See the <xref EXAMPLE>, below,
for how to hook up the gtserver(n) to the <xref commserver(n)>.<p>

Once a gtserver(n) object is created, game truth variables can be
published using the <iref set> method, and clients can be refreshed
using the <iref refresh> method.  Points in time at which the full
set of game truth is guaranteed to be complete and consistent can be
indicated by calling the <iref complete> method.<p>

<section PROTOCOL>

gtserver(n) sends the following messages to clients; note that they
will typically be handled by a <xref gtclient(n)> object:<p>

<dl>
  <dt> <b>gt <i>subcommand</i> ?<i>args...</i>?</b>
  <dd> All messages sent by gtserver(n) have this form.<p>

  <dl>
    <dt> <b>gt startrefresh</b>
    <dd> The simulation is about to refresh all game truth.<p>

    <dt> <b>gt endrefresh</b>
    <dd> The simulation has finished refreshing all game truth.<p>

    <dt> <b>gt set <i>name value</i> ?<i>name value...</i>?</b>
    <dd> This is a game truth update for one or more game truth
         variables..<p>

    <dt> <b>gt unset ?<i>name...</i>?</b>
    <dd> Unsets the named game truth variables.<p>

    <dt> <b>gt clear</b>
    <dd> Unsets all game truth variables.<p>

    <dt> <b>gt complete</b>
    <dd> A game truth update is complete; this indicates that the set
         of game truth is now in a consistent state.<p>

    <dt> <b>gt class</b>
    <dd> Declares that a particular class of simulation object will 
         be created, updated and deleted during the simulation.<p>

    <dt> <b>gt create</b>
    <dd> Creates a simulation object to be stored in a clients database. 
         The object can then be retrieved by interested applications.<p>

    <dt> <b>gt update</b>
    <dd> Updates a simulation object that is stored in a clients database. 
         The object can then be retrieved by interested applications.<p>

    <dt> <b>gt delete</b>
    <dd> Deletes a simulation object that is stored in a clients
         database.<p>
  </dl><p>
</dl>

Most of the messages are map one-to-one with the gtserver(n) object's
methods; the exception is the <iref refresh> method, which generates
the following set of messages:<p>

<pre>
gt startrefresh
gt clear
gt set ...
gt create ...
gt endrefresh
</pre>

<section COMMANDS>

<deflist commands>

<defitem gtserver {gtserver <i>name ?options?</i>}>

Creates a new gtserver(n) object called <i>name</i>. The object is
represented as a new Tcl command in the caller's scope;
<iref gtserver> returns the fully-qualified form of the
<i>name</i>.<p>

The <iref gtserver> may be created with the following options:<p>

<deflist gtserver options>

<defopt {-commserver <i>object</i>}>

The fully-qualified name of the <xref commserver(n)> object which
the gtserver(n) object will use to send game truth messages to clients.<p>

This option must be set at creation time, and is read-only
thereafter.<p>

<defopt {-logger <i>name</i>}>

The name of the <xref logger(n)> object to use to log gtserver(n)
activity.<p>

<defopt {-logcomponent <i>name</i>}>

The component name to pass to the <code>-logger</code> object when
logging messages; defaults to "gt".<p>

<defopt {-db <i>name</i>}>

The sqlite database that contains simulation objects whose data is sent to
attached clients.<p>

</deflist gtserver options>

</deflist commands>

<section "INSTANCE COMMAND">

Each instance of the <iref gtserver> object has the following
subcommands:<p>

<deflist instance>

<defitem cget {$gtserver cget <i>option</i>}>

Returns the value of the specified <i>option</i>.<p>

<defitem configure {$gtserver configure <i>option value...</i>}>

Sets the value of one or more of the object's options.<p>

<defitem set {$gtserver set <i>name value</i> ?<i>name value...</i>?}>

Publishes the named game truth variables with the specified values.
The value will be sent to any current clients, and saved for future
refreshes.<p>

<defitem unset {$gtserver unset <i>name</i> ?<i>name</i>...?}>

Unpublishes the named game truth variables.  The variables are erased from
the gtserver(n)'s memory, and an unset message is sent to all clients.<p>

<defitem clear {$gtserver clear}>

Unpublishes all game truth variables.<p>

<defitem refresh {$gtserver refresh ?<i>id</i>?}>

Sends a game truth refresh to the client with the specified <i>id</i>;
if <i>id</i> is not specified, refreshes all clients.<p>

<defitem complete {$gtserver complete}>

Notifies the clients that the current set of game truth variables is
consistent and complete.  For example, the simulation can call this
method at the end of each timestep to indicate that all published
game truth is consistent with the published simulation time.<p>

<defitem class {$gtserver class <i>class table idcolumn ?-norefresh?</i>}>

Defines a class of simulation object that will be created, updated and perhaps 
deleted. Each class has a corresponding <i>table</i> in the runtime database.
This table is the one that has rows created, updated or deleted. The
<i>idcolumn</i> specifies which column in the table is the key column.
If the <i>-norefresh</i> option is used then this class of simulation object is not
refreshed on a refresh request. This is useful for objects that are refreshed
through other means.
<p>

<defitem update {$gtserver update <i>class id</i> ?<i>dict</i>?}>

Sends a simulation object with the supplied <i>class</i> to attached clients
with an update message. The object will have the supplied <i>id</i>. 
If a <i>dict</i> is supplied, it is sent to clients, otherwise an attempt is 
made to look up the object with the supplied <i>id</i> in the runtime database
and its dict is sent to clients with an update message. The <i>dict</i> can be
a partial dict.<p>

<defitem delete {$gtserver delete <i>class id</i>}>

Sends a delete message to clients with the supplied <i>class</i> and <i>id</i>.
<p>

</deflist instance>

<section EXAMPLE>

The gtserver(n) is initialized as follows; if the application has a single
gtserver(n), it is conventionally called <code>::gt</code>, as shown.<p>

<pre>
# FIRST, create the commserver(n) object
commserver ::cs \
   -logger ::log \
   -logcomponent cs \
   -port ...

# NEXT, create the matching gtserver(n) object
gtserver ::gt \
   -logger ::log \
   -logcomponent gt \
   -commserver ::cs \
   -db ::rdb

# NEXT, publish some data!
gt set x 5
gt set y 10

# NEXT, publish a create
gt create foo 99 {bar 1 baz "Fred" id 99}

# NEXT, publish an update
gt update foo 99 {bar 2}

# NEXT, publish a delete
gt delete foo 99

# NEXT, indicate that monitor data is complete:
gt complete

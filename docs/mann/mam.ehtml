<section SYNOPSIS>

package require simlib <version>
namespace import ::simlib::mam
</pre>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

mam(n) is an implementation of the Mars Affinity Model described in the
<i>Mars Analyst's Guide</i>.  It allows the creation of belief systems and
topics of belief, and computes the affinity between belief systems.

<subsection "Set/Get vs. Configure/Cget">

mam(n) supports both a dictionary-based <tt>set</tt>/<tt>get</tt>
mechanism and an option-based <tt>configure</tt>/<tt>cget</tt> mechanism
for all data.   The <tt>set</tt>/<tt>get</tt> mechanism is the lower-level
API, and is provided for use by application orders and similar  client
code; <tt>configure</tt>/<tt>cget</tt> mechanism is a wrapper around the
<tt>set</tt>/<tt>get</tt> and yields more readable code when belief systems
are modified or queried  directly.

The two mechanisms use identical attribute names, except that the
<tt>configure</tt>/<tt>cget</tt> mechanism uses option notation 
(e.g., "<tt>-position</tt>" vs. "<tt>position</tt>").

<subsection "Undo Mechanisms">

mam(n) is designed to support an application undo stack.  The three
of operations that can be undone are <tt>add</tt>,  
<tt>set</tt>/<tt>configure</tt>, and <tt>delete</tt>.

To undo an <tt>add</tt> of a system or a topic, simply delete the new
entity.  For example,

<pre>
    # Add a new system
    set sid [$mam system add]

    # Undo the addition
    $mam system delete $sid
</pre>

To undo a <tt>set</tt> or <tt>configure</tt>, save the old data before
the change, and then restore it.  For example,

<pre>
    # Save undo data:
    set undoData [$mam system get $sid]

    # Make the change
    $mam system configure $sid -commonality 0.5

    # Undo the change
    $mam system set $sid $undoData
</pre>

To undo a <tt>delete</tt> of a system or topic, use the related
<tt>undelete</tt> command.  For example,

<pre>
    # Delete a system
    set undoData [$mam system delete $sid]

    # Undo the deletion
    $mam system undelete $undoData
</pre>

Of course, these mechanisms are only guaranteed under normal "undo" 
conditions, e.g., a belief system can be "undeleted" when that's the
operation on the top of the undo stack.

<section COMMANDS>

This module defines the following command:

<deflist commands>

<defitem mam {mam <i>name</i>}>

Creates a new mam(n) object named <i>name</i>. The object is
represented as a new Tcl command in the caller's scope;
<iref mam> returns the fully-qualified form of the
<i>name</i>.

</deflist commands>

<section "INSTANCE COMMANDS">

Each instance of mam(n) provides the following subcommands for use by the
application.

<deflist instance>

<defitem "affinity" {<i mam> affinity <i>sid1 sid2</i>}>

Returns the affinity of the belief system with ID <i>sid1</i> with 
the belief system with ID <i>sid2</i>, recomputing the affinities if
necessary.  The affinity is a number from -1.0 to 1.0.


<defitem "belief" {<i mam> belief <i>subcommand</i> ?<i>args...</i>?}>

This family of commands is used for setting and querying the value of 
belief attributes.  A belief is a belief system's position with respect
to a topic; hence, beliefs are identified by the system's unique ID
(the <i>sid</i>) and the topic's unique ID (the <i>tid</i>).

mam(n) defines the following belief options:

<deflist belief attributes>

<defopt {-position <i>number</i>}>

Specifies the system's position with respect to the topic, a real number
from -1.0 to +1.0. Defaults to 0.0. The client can use 
<xref simtypes(n) qposition> to validate position values.

<defopt {-emphasis <i>number</i>}>

Specifies the system's emphasis on agreement or disagreement with respect
to this topic, where 0.0 represents a complete emphasis on disagreement and
1.0 represents a complete emphasis on agreement. The default is 0.5. Note
that the endpoints result in pathological results; clients will usually
want to pick from the
<xref simtypes(n) qemphasis> symbols. Note that 
<xref simtypes(n) qemphasis> can be used to
validate emphasis values.

</deflist belief attributes>

The subcommands of <iref belief> are as follows:

<deflist belief>

<defitem "belief cget" {<i mam> belief cget <i>sid tid option</i>}>

Returns the value of the named <i>option</i> for the belief with the
given <i>sid</i> and <i>tid</i>.

<defitem "belief configure" {<i mam> belief configure <i>sid tid option value...</i>}>

Sets the values of the listed options for the belief with the given
<i>sid</i> and <i>tid</i>.

<defitem "belief get" {<i mam> belief get <i>sid tid</i> ?<i>attr</i>?}>

Returns the value of the named attribute for the belief with the given
<i>sid</i> and <i>tid</i>, if <i>attr</i> is given; otherwise, returns a
dictionary of all of the belief's attributes and their values.

<defitem "belief set" {<i mam> belief set <i>sid tid attr value...</i>}>
<defitem "belief set" {<i mam> belief set <i>sid tid attrdict</i>}>

Sets the values of the named attributes for the belief with the
given <i>sid</i> and <i>tid</i>.  The attribute names and
values may be specified as single argument, a dictionary, or as 
individual names and values on the command line.

</deflist belief>

<defitem "changed" {<i mam> changed}>

Returns 1 if the checkpointable data has changed since the last
<iref checkpoint>, and 0 otherwise.

<defitem "checkpoint" {<i mam> checkpoint ?-saved?}>

Returns a checkpoint of this module's data.  If <b>-saved</b>
is specified, the data is marked "unchanged".

<defitem "clear" {<i mam> clear}>

Clears all data and resets the module to its initial state.

<defitem "compute" {<i mam> compute}>

Computes all affinity values given current settings, and caches them.

<defitem "congruence" {<i mam> congruence <i>sid theta hook</i>}>

Computes and returns the congruence of a semantic <i>hook</i> with the
belief system with ID <i>sid</i>.  The <i>hook</i> is a dictionary of topic
IDs  and position numbers, and <i>theta</i> is the hook's equivalent of a
belief system's commonality fraction.

Congruence is essentially the affinity of the belief system for the
hook, taking into account only the topics included in the hook.

<defitem "dump" {<i mam> dump}>

Returns a human-readable string containing all mam(n) data, for
debugging.

<defitem "playbox" {<i mam> playbox <i>subcommand</i> ?<i>args...</i>?}>

This family of commands is used for setting and querying the value of 
playbox-wide attributes.

mam(n) defines the following playbox-wide options:

<deflist playbox attributes>

<defopt {-gamma <i>value</i>}>

This is the playbox "commonality" dial; it controls the degree of
implicit commonality among the entities in the playbox, that is, the
number of implicit topics about which there is general (and
passionate) agreement in the playbox. If -gamma is 0, there is no
implicit commonality; only explicit topics are considered. If -gamma
is 1.0 there are as many implicit topics as explicit topics; if 0.5,
half as many; if 2.0, twice as many.  The value must be no less than 0.0; 
default is 1.0.

</deflist playbox attributes>

The subcommands of <iref playbox> are as follows:

<deflist playbox>

<defitem "playbox cget" {<i mam> playbox cget <i>option</i>}>

Returns the value of the named option.

<defitem "playbox configure" {<i mam> playbox configure <i>option value...</i>}>

Sets the values of the listed options.

<defitem "playbox get" {<i mam> playbox get ?<i>attr</i>?}>

Returns the value of the named attribute, if given; otherwise,
returns a dictionary of all of the playbox attributes and their
values.

<defitem "playbox set" {<i mam> playbox set <i>attr value...</i>}>
<defitem "playbox set" {<i mam> playbox set <i>attrdict</i>}>

Sets the values of the named attributes.  The attribute names and
values may be specified as single argument, a dictionary, or as 
individual names and values on the command line.

</deflist playbox>

<defitem "restore" {<i mam> restore <i>checkpoint</i> ?-saved?}>

Restores the state of the module given the <i>checkpoint</i>, 
produced by a previous call to <iref checkpoint>.  If 
the <b>-saved</b> option is given, the module's contents will be
marked "unchanged".

<defitem "system" {<i mam> system <i>subcommand</i> ?<i>args...</i>?}>

This family of commands is used for setting and querying the value of 
belief system attributes.

mam(n) defines the following belief system options:

<deflist system attributes>

<defopt {-name <i>name</i>}>

This is the name of the belief system, for display to the user.  
Names must be unique across belief systems.  The default name is
"System <i>sid</i>".

<defopt {-commonality <i>value</i>}>

This is the belief system "commonality" dial; it specifies the extent of
the system's participation in the dominant culture in the playbox. If 1.0,
the system shares all of the implicit cultural commonality; if 0.0, none of
it. Defaults to 1.0. Note that the effect of this option depends on the
playbox <b>-gamma</b> value; see <iref playbox>.

</deflist system attributes>

The subcommands of <iref system> are as follows:

<deflist system>

<defitem "system add" {<i mam> system add <i>sid</i>}>

given <i>sid</i>.

<defitem "system configure" {<i mam> system configure <i>sid option value...</i>}>

Sets the values of the listed options for the system with the given
<i>sid</i>.

<defitem "system delete" {<i mam> system delete <i>sid</i>}>

Deletes the belief system with the given <i>sid</i>, and returns 
a string of undo data that can be passed to <iref system undelete>.

<defitem "system exists" {<i mam> system exists <i>sid</i>}>

Returns 1 if there is a belief system with the given <i>sid</i>, and
a 0 otherwise.

<defitem "system get" {<i mam> system get <i>sid</i> ?<i>attr</i>?}>

with the given <i>sid</i>, if <i>attr</i> is given; otherwise,
returns a dictionary of all of the system's attributes and their
values.

<defitem "system set" {<i mam> system set <i>sid attr value...</i>}>
<defitem "system set" {<i mam> system set <i>sid attrdict</i>}>

Sets the values of the named attributes for the system with the
given <i>sid</i>.  The attribute names and
values may be specified as single argument, a dictionary, or as 
individual names and values on the command line.

<defitem "system undelete" {<i mam> system undelete <i>undoData</i>}>

Given an <i>undoData</i> string from <iref system delete>, undoes

Names must be unique across topics.  The default name is
"Topic <i>tid</i>".

<defopt {-affinity <i>flag</i>}>

Specifies a numeric flag, 0 or 1. If 1 (the default), then beliefs on this
topic will  be included in the computation of affinity; if 0, then it will
be excluded.

<defopt {-relevance <i>fraction</i>}>

Specifies the relevance of the topic as a fraction from 0.0 to 1.0 
(the default). Positions on a topic have decreasing effect as the
topic's relevance declines.

<section DESCRIPTION>

<xref ucurve(n)> is the Tcl API for the Unified Regional
Attitude Model (URAM)'s Curve Manager.  The curve manager is
implements the general attitude curve model.  It manages the curve
types, individual curves, and effects to be applied to them.  It knows
nothing about groups, actors, or the spread of indirect effects;
these are the province of <xref uram(n)> itself.<p>

See the <i>Mars Analyst's Guide</i> for the attitude curve model that
underlies ucurve(n).<p>

The client is responsible for defining the set of curves to be managed:<p>

<ul>
  <li> First, the client must define one or more curve types using
       the <iref ctype> commands.  The
       curve type determines the minimum and maximum bounds for curves
       of this type, as well as the &alpha;, &beta;, and &gamma; parameters
       that determine how the baseline changes over time.<p>

  <li> Next, the client must define curves of each type using the
       <iref curve> commands.  Each curve
       gets a unique integer ID.  It is the client's responsibility to
       associated that ID with other data (e.g., a civilian group and
       concern).<p>

  <li> Next, the client may enter adjustments to curve baselines using
       <iref adjust> and also add <iref persistent> and
       <iref transient> effects. Both adjustments and effects are
       associated with attitude drivers.<p>

  <li> Effects are retained until
       time is advanced using the <iref apply> command.  ucurve(n)
       has no real notion of simulation time; rather, a timestamp is
       passed to <iref apply>, which uses it when saving the history
       of contributions by each attitude driver.<p>

  <li> Adjustments have an immediate effect on the baseline; the
       net delta to the adjusted baseline is retained until 
       time is advanced using the <iref apply> command, and saved
       to the contributions table at that time.<p>

  <li> After adjustments and effects are applied, they are deleted;
       if they are to recur, the client must re-enter them during the
       next timestep.
</ul>

<subsection "Untracked Curves">

The client has the option of marking particular curves as "untracked"
using <iref curve untrack>.  Ucurve(n) does not track changes to 
untracked curves; instead, their current or baseline levels are always
exactly equal to their natural levels.  For example, if the client
allows civilian groups to have zero population then the curves related
to those groups can be untracked.  Tracking can be turned back on
using <iref curve track>, at which point the curve can begin to
fluctuate from its natural level.<p>

Things to note:<p>

<ul>
<li> It is an error to add adjustments or effects to an untracked
     curve.<p>

<li> For performance reasons, the error will not be detected until
     the next time <iref apply> is called, at which point an error
     will be thrown.<p>

<li> If a curve with pending adjustments or effects is untracked,
     the pending changes will be deleted automatically.<p>
</ul>

<subsection "Undo Stack">

Many ucurve(n) operations are undoable; to enable the undo stack, set
the <code>-undo</code> option to <b>on</b>.  The undo stack is then managed
using the <iref edit> command.  Use the <iref edit undo> command
to undo operations up to the last mark.  Marks can be
inserted manually using the <iref edit mark> command, or
automatically inserted with each operation by setting the
<code>-automark</code> option to <b>on</b>.<p>

Commands may be <b>Undoable</b>, <b>Not Undoable</b>, or neither.
A command that is <b>Not Undoable</b> clears the undo stack as part of
its operation.  Commands that are neither usually do not affect the
undo stack one way or another.  The <b>Undoable</b> and <b>Not
Undoable</b> commands are so marked.<p>

The undo capability is provided by <xref undostack(n)>.
A ucurve(n) instance usually belongs to some parent object, i.e.,
an instance of <xref uram(n)>.  The parent object can share its own
<xref undostack(n)> with ucurve(n) using the <code>-undostack</code>
option.<p>

<section "DATABASE SCHEMA">

ucurve(n) stores almost all of its working data in an
<xref sqldocument(n)> "run-time database", or RDB.  
The names of all of the tables, views, indices, and so forth defined
by UCURVE begin with the string "ucurve_".<p>

Other modules may query any of the tables as needed, but
should not alter them.<p>

ucurve(n) registers the following schema definitions with
<xref sqldocument(n)>:<p>

<pre>
<::simlib::ucurve sqlsection schema>
</pre>

<section COMMANDS>

This module defines the following command:<p>

<deflist commands>

<defitem ucurve {ucurve <i>name ?options...?</i>}>

Creates a new <iref ucurve> object named <i>name</i>. The object is
represented as a new Tcl command in the caller's scope;
<iref ucurve> returns the fully-qualified form of the
<i>name</i>.<p>

<iref ucurve> takes the following options:<p>

<deflist ucurve options>

<defopt {-automark <i>flag</i>}>

If <b>on</b> (the default), marks will be inserted in the
<xref "Undo Stack"> automatically.  If <b>off</b>, they will not.<p>

<defopt {-rdb <i>name</i>}>

Specifies the name of an <xref sqldocument(n)> object
which ucurve(n) will use to store its data, and from which it will read
its inputs.  See <xref "DATABASE SCHEMA">.<p>

Each instance of ucurve(n) must be created in a distinct RDB.<p>

This option must be set at creation time, and cannot be changed
thereafter.<p>

<defopt {-savehistory <i>flag</i>}>

If <b>on</b> (the default), ucurve(n) will save the history of
contributions to each curve by each driver in its
<b>ucurve_contribs_t</b> table.  If <b>off</b>, it will not.  Setting
the option to <b>off</b> will delete any existing contents of the
<b>ucurve_contribs_t</b> table.<p>

<defopt {-undo <i>flag</i>}>

If <b>on</b>, then ucurve(n) will maintain an <xref "Undo Stack">.
If <b>off</b> (the default) it will not.

<defopt {-undostack <i>cmd</i>}>

By default, ucurve(n) will create its own instance of
<xref undostack(n)> to manage its <xref "Undo Stack">.  However,
an instance of ucurve(n) will often be owned by a parent object (e.g.,
<xref uram(n)> which has its own <xref undostack(n)>.  The parent
can share its undo stack by setting this option to the name of the
<xref undostack(n)> object.<p>

This option must be set at creation time, and cannot be changed
thereafter.<p>

</deflist ucurve options>

</deflist commands>

<section "INSTANCE COMMAND">

<deflist instance>

<defitem adjust {$obj adjust <i>driver_id curve_id delta</i> ?<i>curve_id delta...</i>?}>

<b>Undoable.</b> Creates one or more adjustments associated with the given
<i>driver_id</i>.  Each adjustment is specified as a curve ID/delta
pair, where the delta will be applied as is (i.e., unscaled) to the
curve's baseline value.<p>

The delta is applied immediately; its net delta will be saved as
part of the driver's contribution the next time
<iref apply> is called.<p>

<defitem apply {$obj apply <i>t</i> ?-start?}>

<b>Not Undoable.</b> Applies and deletes all pending adjustments and
effects, and records their actual contributions by curve and driver at time
<i>t</i>, which is specified as an integer tick.

Note that ucurve(n) has no little real notion of simulation time;
<i>t</i> is usually used only as a time stamp.<p>

If the option <b>-start</b> is given, ucurve(n) does two special things.  
First, the current attitude levels are recomputed given any pending transient
effects; the baseline levels are unchanged, and any pending persistent
effects will be thrown away unused.  Second, the current <b>a</b>,
<b>b</b>, and <b>c</b> values for each attitude curve are saved to the 
<b>a0</b>, <b>b0</b>, and <b>c0</b> columns in the
<b>ucurve_curves_t</b> table for future reference.
This is allows the client to initialize the <b>a</b> values with
transient effects based on the simulation starting conditions.<p>

It is an error if there are pending adjustments or effects on 
untracked curves.  See <xref "Untracked Curves"> for more
details.<p>

<defitem cget {$obj cget <i>option</i>}>

Returns the value of the specified <i>option</i>.<p>

<defitem clear {$obj clear}>

<b>Not Undoable.</b> Restores the instance to its creation state.
This includes deleting all ucurve(n) data from the RDB tables.<p>

<defitem configure {$obj configure <i>option value</i>}>

Sets the <i>value</i> of the specified <i>option</i> (if the option is
not read-only).<p>

<defitem ctype {$obj ctype <i>subcommand</i> ?<i>value...</i>?}>

This family of commands is used to create and manage the set of curve
types and their parameters.<p>

<deflist ctype>

<defitem "ctype add" {$obj ctype add <i>name min max</i> ?<i>options...</i>}>

<b>Undoable.</b> Adds a new curve type with the given <i>name</i>.  Curves of this type
will have the specified <i>min</i> and <i>max</i> bounds, which may be
integer or floating point numbers.  By default the curve type will
have &alpha; and &gamma; parameters of 0.0, resulting in a &beta; of
1.0.<p>

The command returns the new curve type's numeric ID.<p>

The type may be created with the following options:<p>

<deflist ctype options>

<defopt {-alpha <i>value</i>}>
<defopt {-gamma <i>value</i>}>

These options set the curve type's &alpha; and &gamma; parameters;
&beta; is computed automatically so that the three values sum to 1.0.
The <i>value</i> must be between 0.0 and 1.0.<p>

</deflist ctype options>

<defitem "ctype cget" {$obj ctype cget <i>name option</i>}>

Returns the value of the specified <i>option</i> for curve type
<i>name</i>.  In addition to the creation options (see
<iref ctype add>, the client can also query the following:<p>

<deflist ctype cget options>

<defopt {-beta <i>value</i>}>

The curve type's computed &beta; value.<p>

<defopt {-min <i>value</i>}>
<defopt {-max <i>value</i>}>

The curve type's minimum and maximum bounds.<p>

</deflist ctype cget options>

<defitem "ctype configure" {$obj ctype configure <i>option value</i>}>

<b>Undoable.</b> Sets the <i>value</i> of the specified curve type creation
<i>option</i>; see <iref ctype add> for the list.<p>

<defitem "ctype delete" {$obj ctype delete <i>name</i>}>

<b>Undoable.</b> Deletes the named curve type, along with all related
data.<p>

<defitem "ctype id" {$obj ctype id <i>name</i>}>

Returns the numeric ID associated with the curve type <i>name</i>, or
"" if none is found. The numeric ID is used to associate a curve type
with specific curves.<p>

<defitem "ctype name" {$obj ctype name <i>id</i>}>

Returns the curve type name associated with the curve type <i>id</i>.<p>

<defitem "ctype names" {$obj ctype names}>

Returns the names of all curve types.<p>

</deflist ctype>

<defitem curve {$obj curve <i>subcommand</i> ?<i>value...</i>?}>

This family of commands is used to create and manage curves of various
curve types.<p>

<deflist curve>

<defitem "curve add" {$obj curve add <i>ctype a b c</i> ?<i>a b c...</i>?}>

<b>Undoable.</b> This command defines one or more curves of curve type
<i>ctype</i>, which may be either a curve type name or ID.  Each curve
is defined by its A, B, and C values at time 0, each of which is a
numeric value within the minimum and maximum bounds for the curve
type.<p>

The command returns a list of curve IDs, one for each curve, in the
order of definition.<p>

<b>NOTE:</b> This command is designed for speed, and hence does
minimal error checking.  It is the client's responsibility to make
sure that all A, B, and C values are valid.<p>

<defitem "curve bset" {$obj curve bset <i>curve_id b</i> ?<i>curve_id b</i>?}>

<b>Not Undoable.</b>  Sets the B values for one or more curve IDs.
This command is designed for speed; it is the client's
responsibility to ensure that the arguments are valid.<p>

<defitem "curve cget" {$obj curve cget <i>curve_id option</i>}>

Retrieves the value of <i>option</i> for curve <i>curve_id</i>.
The following options can be retrieved:<p>

<deflist options>

<defopt {-b}>

The curve's B value.<p>

<defopt {-c}>

The curve's C value.<p>

<defopt {-tracked}>

The curve's "tracked" flag, 1 if the curve is tracked and 0 if it is
untracked.<p>


</deflist options>

<defitem "curve configure" {$obj curve configure <i>curve_id</i> ?<i>options...</i>?}>

<b>Undoable.</b> Modifies the curve with the given <i>curve_id</i>.
The options are as follows:<p>

<deflist options>

<defopt {-b <i>value</i>}>

Sets the curve's B value.<p>

<defopt {-c <i>value</i>}>

Sets the curve's C value.<p>

</deflist options>

<defitem "curve cset" {$obj curve cset <i>curve_id c</i> ?<i>curve_id c</i>...?}>

<b>Not Undoable.</b>  Sets the C values for one or more curve IDs.
This command is designed for speed; it is the client's
responsibility to ensure that the arguments are valid.<p>

<defitem "curve exists" {$obj curve exists <i>curve_id</i>}>

Returns 1 if there is a curve with the given <i>curve_id</i>, and 0
otherwise.<p>

<defitem "curve track" {$obj curve track <i>curve_ids</i>}>

<b>Not Undoable.</b>  Given a list of curve IDs, marks all of the
listed curves "tracked".  See <xref "Untracked Curves"> for
details.<p>

<defitem "curve untrack" {$obj curve untrack <i>curve_ids</i>}>

<b>Not Undoable.</b>  Given a list of curve IDs, marks all of the
listed curves "untracked", and deletes any pending adjustments or
effects on them.  See <xref "Untracked Curves"> for details.<p>

</deflist curve>

<defitem edit {$obj edit <i>subcommand</i> ?<i>value...</i>?}>

This family of commands manages the <xref "Undo Stack">.  This
capability is available only when the <code>-undo</code> option is set
to <b>on</b>.<p>

<deflist edit>

<defitem "edit canundo" {$obj edit canundo}>

Returns 1 if there's a command on the stack to be undone, and 0 otherwise.<p>

<defitem "edit reset" {$obj edit reset}>

Clears the undo stack.<p>

<defitem "edit mark" {$obj edit mark}>

Adds a mark to the undo stack.  The <iref edit undo> command
undoes all operations back to the last mark (or until the stack
is empty).  This allows a set of ucurve(n) commands relating to a
single client operation to be undone as a group.<p>

Alternatively, the <code>-automark</code> option may be set to
<b>on</b>, and each ucurve(n) command will insert a matching
mark, allowing them to be undone individually.<p>

<defitem "edit undo" {$obj edit undo}>

Undoes all commands back to the most recent mark, or until the
stack is empty if there are no marks.  It's an error if there is
no command to be undone.<p>

</deflist edit>

<defitem istracked {$obj istracked <i>curve_id</i>}>

Returns 1 if the curve is tracked, and 0 otherwise.<p>

<defitem persistent {$obj persistent <i>driver_id cause_id curve_id mag</i> ?<i>curve_id mag...</i>?}>

<b>Undoable.</b>  Creates one or more persistent effects related to
attitude driver <i>driver_id</i> with cause <i>cause_id</i>.  Each
effect is specified as a curve ID/magnitude pair; the magnitude will
ultimately be scaled based on the curve's baseline.<p>

The created effects will remain pending until the next time
<iref apply> is called.  At that time they will applied,
and deleted.<p>

Persistent effects are scaled (with causes taken into account)
relative to the baseline B.t; the resulting delta is then applied
to the baseline, resulting in a new B.t for the current time step.
The extent to which the resulting delta will actually persist in
future time steps depends on the curve type's &beta; parameter.<p>

<defitem reset {$obj reset}>

Resets all curves to their initial values and deletes all pending
adjustments and effects and historical contributions.<p>

<defitem transient {$obj transient <i>driver_id cause_id curve_id mag</i> ?<i>curve_id mag...</i>?}>

<b>Undoable.</b>  Creates one or more transient effects related to
attitude driver <i>driver_id</i> with cause <i>cause_id</i>.  Each
effect is specified as a curve ID/magnitude pair; the magnitude will
ultimately be scaled based on the current baseline for the curve.<p>

The created effects will remain pending until the next time
<iref apply> is called.  At that time they will be applied and deleted.<p>

Effects are scaled (with causes taken into account) relative to the
baseline B.t after all persistent effects have been applied; the
result delta is applied to the curve's A value for the current time
step.  The extent to which the resulting delta will persist into
future time steps depends on the curve type's &alpha; parameter.<p>

<section DESCRIPTION>

rmf(n) defines a family of "relationship multiplier functions", or
"RMFs".  An RMF translates an <xref simtypes(n) rgrouprel> value, a
number that ranges from -1.0 (perfect enemies) to 1.0 (perfect
friends), into a multiplier.  Models use
RMFs to determine the magnitude of an effect based on the relationship
between the affected group and the acting group.<p>

The various RMFs are implemented as subcommands of the <iref rmf>
command.  Because there are many RMFs, and because the RMF to be
used in a particular rule can be set in the <xref parmdb(5)>,
<iref rmf> is also an <xref enum(n)> of the RMF names, which are
as follows:<p>

<fromproject {::simlib::rmf html}><p>

<subsection "Configuration Parameters">

rmf(n) is a <xref parm(i)>, and defines the following configuration
parameter.  The <iref rmf parm> subcommand can be used to set and query
parameter values.<p>

<expand [fromproject {::simlib::rmf parm manpage}]>

<subsection "Function Plots">

The functions which correspond to these names are as follows, assuming
that the <b>rmf.nominalRelationship</b> parameter is set to its
default value of 
<fromproject {::simlib::rmf parm getdefault rmf.nominalRelationship}>.
Note that where the plots cross the -1.0 and 1.0 lines they do so at
&plusmn;<fromproject {::simlib::rmf parm getdefault rmf.nominalRelationship}>
<p>

If <b>rmf.nominalRelationship</b> is set to 1.0, we get the RMFs used
in JNEM 2.1.  Note that where the plots cross the -1.0 and 1.0 lines,
they do so at &plusmn;1.0.<p>

<section COMMANDS>

<deflist commands>

<defitem rmf {rmf <i>subcommand</i> ?<i>args...</i>?}>

The <iref rmf> command has all of the standard
<xref enum(n)> subcommands; the following are defined as well.<p>

In what follows, the value of the <b>rmf.nominalRelationship</b>
parameter is indicated by <i>Rnom</i>.<p>

<deflist rmf>

<defitem {rmf parm} {rmf parm <i>subcommand</i> ?<i>args..</i>?}>

The <iref rmf parm> subcommand gives access to the rmf(n) module's
configuration <xref parmset(n)>; see
<xref "Configuration Parameters"> for details.  The subcommands
of <iref rmf parm> are exactly those of <xref parmset(n)>
instances.<p>


<defitem "rmf constant" {rmf constant <i>R</i> ?<i Rnom>?}>

Returns a constant 1.0 regardless of <i>R</i>.
The "Constant" function should be used when the
relationship between the two groups should have no effect.<p>

The <i Rnom> argument is ignored.<p>

<defitem "rmf linear" {rmf linear <i>R</i> ?<i Rnom>?}>

Returns <i>R/Rnom</i>.  The "Linear" function should be used when the
effect of an input should be directly proportional to the strength of the
relationship.<p>

If given, the <i Rnom> argument overrides the
<tt rmf.nominalRelationship> parameter.<p>

<defitem "rmf quad" {rmf quad <i>R</i> ?<i Rnom>?}>

Returns (<i>R/Rnom</i>)&sup2;&sdot;sign(<i>R</i>).  The "Quad" function
is similar to <iref rmf linear> but has a weaker effect for <i>R</i> &lt;
<i>Rnom</i> and a stronger effect for <i>R</i> &gt; <i>Rnom</i>.<p>

Note that friends are affected with the same sign as
the input's magnitude, and enemies with the opposite sign, i.e.,
if friends are affected positively then enemies are affected negatively.<p>

If given, the <i Rnom> argument overrides the
<tt rmf.nominalRelationship> parameter.<p>

<defitem "rmf frquad" {rmf frquad <i>R</i> ?<i Rnom>?}>

Returns (<i>R/Rnom</i>)&sup2; where <i>R</i> &gt; 0, and 0 otherwise.  Friends
are affected according to the strength of the relationship, but
enemies are not affected at all.<p>

If given, the <i Rnom> argument overrides the
<tt rmf.nominalRelationship> parameter.<p>

<defitem "rmf frmore" {rmf frmore <i>R</i> ?<i Rnom>?}>

Returns ((1+<i>R</i>)/(1+<i>Rnom</i>))&sup2;.  Both enemies and friends are
affected, but enemies are affected much less than friends, and
perfect enemies are not affected at all.<p>

Note that both friends and enemies are affected with the same sign
as the input's magnitude; thus, if it is a positive input then
both friends and enemies are affected positively.<p>

If given, the <i Rnom> argument overrides the
<tt rmf.nominalRelationship> parameter.<p>

<defitem "rmf enquad" {rmf enquad <i>R</i> ?<i Rnom>?}>

Returns (<i>R/Rnom</i>)&sup2; where <i>R</i> &lt; 0, and 0 otherwise.  Enemies
are affected according to the strength of the relationship, but
friends are not affected at all.<p>

If given, the <i Rnom> argument overrides the
<tt rmf.nominalRelationship> parameter.<p>

<defitem "rmf enmore" {rmf enmore <i>R</i> ?<i Rnom>?}>

Returns ((1&minus;<i>R</i>)/(1+<i>Rnom</i>))&sup2;.  Both enemies and
friends are affected, but friends are affected much less than enemies,
and perfect friends are not affected at all.<p>

Note that both friends and enemies are affected with the same sign
as the input's magnitude; thus, if it is a positive input then
both friends and enemies are affected positively.<p>

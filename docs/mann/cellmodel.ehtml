<section SYNOPSIS>

<pre>
package require marsutil 3.0
namespace import ::marsutil::cellmodel
</pre>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

Instances of the cellmodel(n) type implement "cell models".  A cell
model is essentially a spreadsheet model without the two-dimensional
layout or presentation features.  A cell model consists of one or more
cells; each cell has a name (as opposed to row and column
coordinates), a value, and (optionally) a formula.  Formulas can
contain references to the values of other cells.

The cellmodel(n) instance provides the infrastructure; actual models
(i.e., the cells with their values and formulas) are read from cell
model files, which by convention have a ".cm" file type.  See the
<xref cellmodel(5)> man page for documentation on the contents of a
cell model file.

Just as a spreadsheet can contain multiple linked worksheets, a
cell model can contain multiple "pages".  A formula on a given 
page can refer to cells on its own page by name, and cells on
previous pages by page name and cell name.
(See <xref cellmodel(5)>.)

Once a cell model is loaded, the program can modify cell values and
and ask the cellmodel(n) instance to recompute the model.

<section COMMANDS>

<deflist commands>

<defitem cellmodel {cellmodel <i>name</i> ?<i>option value...</i>?}>

Creates a new cellmodel(n) object called <i>name</i>. The object is
represented as a new Tcl command in the caller's scope;
<iref cellmodel> returns the fully-qualified form of the
<i>name</i>.  The cellmodel(n) object can be created with the
following options:

<deflist options>

<defopt {-epsilon <i>epsilon</i>}>

Specifies the epsilon for the convergence test when iterating the
model to a solution.  The default value is 0.0001.  The epsilon can be
thought of as defining the number of signficant digits in the output,
one for each decimal place.

<defopt {-failcmd <i>cmd</i>}>

Specifies a command to call when a cell model solution fails. The command
is appended with three arguments, the instance of the cell model object, 
the type of failure - either <b>diverge</b>
or <b>errors</b> and the page name in which the failure happened.

<defopt {-maxiters <i>maxiters</i>}>

Specifies the maximum number of iterations when iterating the model to
a solution.  The default value is 100.  If the model does not converge
without <code>-maxiters</code> iterations, it is said to diverge.

<defopt {-tracecmd <i>cmd</i>}>

Specifies a command to call to trace the recomputation of the model.
The command is called with a number of additional arguments; the
precise number depends on the first argument.

The argument patterns are as follows:

<deflist patterns>

<defitem trace_iterate {iterate <i>page iteration maxdelta</i>}>

The <code>-tracecmd</code> is called with these arguments before the
first iteration of each cyclic page, and after each individual
iteration of the page.  The arguments are the <i>page</i> name, the
iteration number (0 before the first iteration, and incrementing for
each iteration thereafter) and the iteration's <i>maxdelta</i>.  The
max delta is a measure of convergence.

<defitem trace_converge {converge <i>page iterations</i>}>

If the page converges, the <code>-tracecmd</code> is called with these
arguments, where <i>page</i> is the page name and <i>iterations</i> is
the number of iterations required to reach convergence.

</deflist patterns>

</deflist options>

</deflist commands>

<section "INSTANCE COMMAND">

Each instance of the <iref cellmodel> object has the following
subcommands:

<deflist instance>

<defitem cget {<i>object</i> cget <i>option</i>}>

Returns the value of the specified <i>option</i>.

<defitem cells {<i>object</i> cells ?<i>page</i>?}>

Returns a list of fully-qualified cell names in order of definition.
The <i>page</i> argument, if given, should be a valid page name, or
one of the following symbolic constants:

<ul>
  <li> <b>all</b> -- All cells (this is the default)
  <li> <b>unused</b> -- Cells defined in the model that aren't
       referred to any formula.
  <li> <b>unknown</b> -- Cells referred to in formulas but not defined
       in the model.
  <li> <b>error</b> -- Cells whose formulas contain an error.
  <li> <b>invalid</b> -- The union of the <b>unknown</b> and
       <b>error</b> cells.
</ul>

Sane models don't contain <b>unknown</b> cells.  Some <b>error</b>
cells can be caught during the initial sanity check; others will be
caught when the model is solved.

<defitem cellinfo {<i>object</i> cellinfo <i>field cell</i>}>

Returns information about the specified <i>cell</i>.  The available
<i>field</i> names are as follows:

<ul>
  <li> <b>page</b> -- The name of the page on which the <i>cell</i>
       appears.
  <li> <b>line</b> -- The line number at which the cell is defined in
       the model script.
  <li> <b>bare</b> -- The cell's bare (unqualified) name.
  <li> <b>ctype</b> -- Cell Type: whether the cell is a <b>constant</b> or a
       <b>formula</b> cell.
  <li> <b>vtype</b> -- Value Type: whether the cell is a <b>number</b> or a
       <b>symbol</b> cell.
  <li> <b>ivalue</b> -- The cell's initial value.
  <li> <b>formula</b> -- The cell's formula, or "" if none.
  <li> <b>uses</b> -- A list of the fully-qualified names of the cells
       used by this cell's formula.
  <li> <b>usedby</b> -- A list of the fully-qualified names of the
       cells whose formulas reference this cell.
  <li> <b>unknown</b> -- A list of the names of cells referenced by
       this cell's formula that aren't actually defined in the
       model.
  <li> <b>badpage</b> -- A list of the cells referenced by this
       cell's formula that are defined on pages that are
       defined <b>after</b> this cell's page.  (Formulas can only
       reference cells defined on the same and previous pages.)
  <li> <b>error</b> -- Any error message associated with this cell, or "".
</ul>

<defitem clear {<i>object</i> clear}>

Deletes any loaded model from the <i>object</i>.


<defitem configure {<i>object</i> configure <i>option value...</i>}>

Sets the value of one or more of the object's options.

<defitem dump {<i>object</i> dump ?<i>page</i>?}>

Returns a pretty-printed string containing the name, value, and
formula for every cell in the model.  If a <i>page</i> name is given,
only cells on that page are included.

<defitem eval {<i>object</i> eval <i>formula</i>}>

Evaluates a <xref cellmodel(5)> formula in the context of the cell
model, given the current cell values, and returns the result.  Note
that invalid cell names are treated as zeroes.

<defitem formula {<i>object</i> formula <i>cell</i>}>

Returns the formula associated with the named <i>cell</i>, or "" if none.

<defitem get {<i>object</i> get ?<i>page</i>? ?-bare?}>

Returns a dictionary of cell names with their current values for the
specified <i>page</i>, or for <b>all</b> pages; <i>page</i> defaults
to <b>all</b>.  

In either of the above cases, the cell names are qualified by their page
names, e.g., the <b>MyNumber</b> cell on the <b>Data</b> page is
called <b>Data::MyNumber</b>.  When retrieving a single page, however,
the dictionary can be retrieved with unqualified cell names by
specifying the <b>-bare</b> option.

<defitem index {<i>object</i> index ?<i>name</i>?}>

Called with no arguments, this method returns a list of the names of
the indices defined in the current model using the
<xref cellmodel(5) index> command.  If <i>name</i> is given, returns
the list of values associated with the named index.

<defitem initial {<i>object</i> initial}>

Returns a dictionary of fully qualified cell names and values just prior to
the start of the most recent attempt to solve. This is useful for debugging
when a cell model fails to solve.

<defitem iterate {<i>object</i> iterate <i>page</i>}>

Computes all values for the named <i>page</i> in order of definition,
and return a list containing the max delta and the name of the cell
that yielded the max delta.  It will seldom be necessary for the
client to use the method directly.

<defitem load {<i>object</i> load <i>model</i>}>

Loads a <i>model</i> into the object, replacing any previous model.
The input is a <xref cellmodel(5)> model definition.

If the model cannot be loaded due to syntax errors, <iref load>
throws an error with error code "<b>SYNTAX <i>line_number</i></b>",
where <i>linenumber</i> is the line number of the input in the
<i>model</i>.

Otherwise, <iref load> returns 1 if the model appears to be "sane", and 
0 if there are obvious errors.

<defitem pages {<i>object</i> pages}>

Returns a list of the names of the model's pages in the order of
definition.

<defitem pageinfo {<i>object</i> pageinfo <i>field page</i>}>

Returns information about the specified <i>page</i>.  The available
<i>field</i> names are as follows:

<ul>
  <li> <b>pline</b> -- The line number at which the page definition
       begins in the model script.
  <li> <b>cyclic</b> -- 1 if the page is cyclic, and 0 if the page is
       acyclic (or if the model is not sane).
  <li> <b>order</b> -- Returns the order in which cells on acyclic
       pages are computed, which might be different from the order of
       definition.  (Because the page is acyclic, each formula can be
       computed only once--provided it's done in the right order.)
       Returns the empty list for cyclic pages (or if the model is
       not sane).
</ul>

<defitem reset {<i>object</i> reset}>

Resets all cell values to their initial values.

<defitem sane {<i>object</i> sane}>

Returns 1 if the currently loaded model is "sane", i.e., contains no
obvious errors, and 0 otherwise.

<defitem set {<i>object</i> set <i>dict</i> ?<i>page</i>?}>

Sets the values of one or more cells given a Tcl dictionary of the
cell names and values.  By default the cell names must be
fully-qualified.  If the <i>dict</i> contains unqualified cell names
for a particular page, specify the <i>page</i> name as well.

<defitem solve {<i>object</i> solve ?<i>from</i> ?<i>to</i>??}>

Attempts to solve the model, computing each page in order.
Acyclic pages are computed once, and cyclic pages are iterated to
convergence (if possible).  Returns "<b>ok</b>" if the computation was
successful; "<b>diverge <i>page</i></b>" if the named page diverged,
and "<b>errors <i>page</i></b>" if there were outright errors (e.g.,
division by zero) on the named page.

Note that it's an error to call <iref solve> if the model is not
<iref sane>.

By default, all pages are solved.  If <i>from</i> is given, the named
page is solved.  If <i>from</i> and <i>to</i> are given, the specified
range of pages are solved.  If <i>to</i> is <b>end</b>, then all pages
are solved from the <i>from</i> page to the end of the set of pages.

<defitem value {<i>object</i> value <i>cell</i>}>

Returns the current value of the named <i>cell</i>.  The cell
must exist.

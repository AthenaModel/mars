<section DESCRIPTION>

<deflist program>

<defitem {mars cmtool} {mars cmtool <i>subcommand</i> ?<i>options...</i>?}>

</deflist program>

mars_cmtool(1) is a command-line tool for working with <xref cellmodel(5)>
models; see that man page for specifics of the <xref cellmodel(5)>
syntax and semantics.  It defines a number of subcommands, each of
which has its own syntax.<p>

To check a model file for errors, use <iref check>.  To dump the
cells and formulas in the model, use <iref dump>; this is useful to
verify that <xref cellmodel(5)> macros have expanded as expected.
The <iref xref> command shows who references each cell.<p>

There are three ways to solve the model and output results.  The
<iref solve> command solves the model once, and can output a variety
of detailed information about the solution.  This is the command to
use to find out why a model does not converge.<p>

The <iref run> command solves the model for a small number of cases,
entered on the command line, and outputs the results in parallel
columns.<p>

The <iref mash> command solves the model for a large number of
cases, looking for problems and logging a selected set of inputs and
outputs for plotting or other analysis.<p>

<section COMMANDS>

The application's subcommands are as follows:<p>

<deflist subcommands>

<defitem check {mars cmtool check <i>modelfile</i>}>

Loads a <xref cellmodel(5)> model from <i>modelfile</i>.  If the file
cannot be loaded, outputs an error and halts.  Otherwise, outputs a
detailed sanity check of the model.  If <iref run> or <iref solve>
reject a model becase it is not "sane", use this command to determine
the problem.<p>

<defitem dump {mars cmtool dump <i>modelfile</i> ?-page <i>page</i>?}>

Produces a dump of the cells in the model, including their values and
formulas.  If the <b>-page</b> option is included, the output only
includes the cells from the named <i>page</i>.<p>

<defitem help {mars cmtool help}>

Outputs a list of the available subcommands, with a one-line
description of each.<p>

<defitem mash {mars cmtool mash <i>modelfile mashfile</i> ?<i>options...</i>?}>

This command runs the model contained in <i>modelfile</i> for the
cases defined in the <i>mashfile</i>, and saves a variety of outputs
as determined by the options.  See <xref "MASH FILE"> for
information on how to set up a mash file.<p>

Called with no options, it simply outputs the number of cases that
had problems.  The options are as follows:<p>

<deflist options>

<defopt {-epsilon <i>epsilon</i>}>

Specifies the <i>epsilon</i> to use in the convergence test.  Defaults
to 0.0001.<p>

<defopt {-maxiters <i>num</i>}>

Specifies the maximum number of iterations when iterating a cyclic
page to convergence.  If the page's "max delta" is still greater than
the <b>-epsilon</b> after <i>num</i> iterations, the page is said to
have diverged.  Defaults to 100.<p>

<defopt {-logfile <i>filename</i>}>

Logs the input and output cell values for all cases to the named
file.<p>

Each row contains an integer case ID, a flag (<b ok> or <b no>)
that indicates whether the case was succesful or not, and the values of
the input and output cells in the order they were defined in the
mash file.<p>

The first row of the while contains the column names: "cid", "ok", and
the cell names.<p>

Columns are delimited by whitespace.<p>

<defopt {-csvfile <i>filename</i>}>

Logs the successful cases in Comma-Separated-Value format, suitable
for loading into a spreadsheet application.  The
columns are the same as for the <b>-logfile</b>, except that the
"ok" column is omitted.<p>

<defopt {-errfile <i>filename</i>}>

Any problem cases are logged to the named file.  For each case,
the file will contain a line with the case ID and a dictionary of
the input values, followed by one indented line for each problem
found.  Note that a case is a failure if it diverges, or if any of
the conditions required by the mash file are not met.<p>

</deflist options>

<defitem run {mars cmtool run <i>modelfile</i> ?<i>options...</i>?}>

Solves the model in the named file one or more times, and outputs a
comparison of the results for the different cases.  The options are as
follows:<p>

<deflist options>

<defopt {-epsilon <i>epsilon</i>}>

Specifies the <i>epsilon</i> to use in the convergence test.  Defaults
to 0.0001.<p>

<defopt {-maxiters <i>num</i>}>

Specifies the maximum number of iterations when iterating a cyclic
page to convergence.  If the page's "max delta" is still greater than
the <b>-epsilon</b> after <i>num</i> iterations, the page is said to
have diverged.  Defaults to 100.<p>

<defopt {-case <i>name</i> ?<i>cell value...</i>?}>

This option may be repeated any number of times to define individual
cases.  Each case has a <i>name</i>, used as a column header in the
output, and may specify the starting values of one or more cells.
Before running each case, the model is reset, and the specified values
are assigned to the cells.<p>

</deflist options>

<defitem solve {mars cmtool solve <i>modelfile</i> ?<i>options...</i>?}>

Attempts solve the model, computing acyclic pages and iterating
acyclic pages to convergence, writing a dump of the final values to
standard output.  The options allow the computation to be controlled
and traced.<p>

<deflist options>

<defopt {-epsilon <i>epsilon</i>}>

Specifies the <i>epsilon</i> to use in the convergence test.  Defaults
to 0.0001.<p>

<defopt {-initfrom <i>filename</i>}>

Specifies a file that contains fully qualified cell names and values
that the cellmodel reads for the purpose of setting
initial values. This is useful when debugging initial conditions
from some other source (such as Athena) that cause the cell model
to not solve.<p> 


<defopt {-maxiters <i>num</i>}>

Specifies the maximum number of iterations when iterating a cyclic
page to convergence.  If the page's "max delta" is still greater than
the <b>-epsilon</b> after <i>num</i> iterations, the page is said to
have diverged.  Defaults to 100.<p>

<defopt {-dumpstart}>

Dumps the model (as for <iref dump>) with its initial cell values,
before computing any pages.<p>

<defopt {-dumpfinal}>

Dumps the model (as for <iref dump>) after all computations are
complete.  If pages diverged, the dumped values might or might not be
useful.  If no other output is requested, this option is assumed.<p>

<defopt {-diffpages <i>a b</i>}>

Dumps a comparison of the content of the two pages named <i>a</i> and
<i>b</i>.  This option may be repeated multiple times, to request
comparisons of additional pairs of pages.<p>

<defopt {-logiters <i>page</i>}>

Logs the iteration delta for each iteration of the named <i>page</i>.
This option may be repeated multiple times, to request logging for
multiple pages.<p>

<defopt {-dumpiters <i>page</i>}>

Does a <iref dump> of the intermediate values following each
iteration of <i>page</i>.  This option may be repeated multiple times,
to request iteration dumping for multiple pages.<p>

<defopt {-tracevalues <i>page</i>}>

After the named <i>page</i> has converged or diverged, outputs a table
of the page's cell values for the first and last three iterations.
This can be useful when diagnosing divergence errors.  This option may
be repeated multiple times, to request tracing for multiple
pages.<p>

<defopt {-tracedeltas <i>page</i>}>

After the named <i>page</i> has converged or diverged, outputs a table
of the deltas for each of the page's cell values for the first and
last three iterations.  This can be useful when diagnosing divergence
errors.  This option may be repeated multiple times, to request
tracing for multiple pages.<p>

</deflist options>

<defitem xref {mars cmtool xref <i>modelfile</i>}>

For each cell, in order of definition, outputs a list of the other
cells whose formulas reference the cell.<p>

</deflist subcommands>

<section "MASH FILE">

The "mash file" required by the <iref mash> subcommand is a
Tcl-formatted file containing the following commands:<p>

<deflist mash>

<defitem range {range <i>cell lower upper step</i>}>

Directs <iref mash> to run the model for a number of values
of the named input <i>cell</i>, from <i>lower</i> to <i>upper</i> with a
step size of <i>step</i>.  For example,<p>

<pre>
    range A 0 5 1
</pre>

will run the model with A taking on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.<p>

Note that the <i>upper</i> value will be included only if the
difference between <i>upper</i> and <i>lower</i> is a multiple of
<i>step</i>, <b>and</b> round-off error doesn't prevent it.<p>

If the mash file contains multiple <iref range> commands, the model
will be run for all combinations.<p>

Note that <i>lower</i>, <i>upper</i>, and <i>step</i> can be either
numbers or formulas; the formulas will be evaluated in the context of
the cell model, given the values of the other cells.  For example,<p>

<pre>
    range A 1 100 1
    range B 1 {[A]} 1
</pre>

For each value of A from 1 to 100, B will range from 1 to the current
value of A.<p>

<defitem let {let <i>cell</i> = <i>formula</i>}>

Assigns an input <i>cell</i> the value indicated by the
<i>formula</i>, which is evaluated in the context of the cell model.
This is used to give an input a value that's related to the values of
one or more other inputs.  For example,<p>

<pre>
    range A 100 500 10
    let   B = {[A] * 1.5}
</pre>

B will always have a value 50% higher than that of A.<p>

<defitem log {log <i>cell</i>}>

Tells <iref mash> to include the named <i>cell</i> in the
<b>-logfile</b> and <b>-csvfile</b>. (Note that cells named in
<iref range> and <iref let> commands are logged automatically.)
For example,<p>

<pre>
    log C
</pre>

will log the value of C for each case.<p>

<defitem require {require <i>condition</i>}>

Specifies a logical <i>condition</i> that must be true for a case to
be considered successful, in addition to convergence.  The
<i>condition</i> is a boolean expression to be evaluated in the
context of the cell model.  For example,<p>

<pre>
    require {[A] == [B]}
</pre>

requires that cells A and B should have the same value or the case is
a failure.  Note that when doing this kind of comparison it's often
wise to use the <xref cellmodel(5) ediff>() function, and require
that the cell values are equal to within <b>-epsilon</b>:<p>

<pre>
    require {ediff([A],[B]) == 0}
</pre>

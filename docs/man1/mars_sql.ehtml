<section SYNOPSIS>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

<deflist program>

<defitem {mars sql} {mars sql <i>db_file</i> [-create]}>

</deflist program>

mars_sql(1) is a browser for SQLite database files.  It allows the
user to view the database schema and enter arbitrary queries,
including updates and deletes.<p>

When invoked with the name of an SQLite database file,
mars_sql(1) opens the file using an
<xref sqldocument(n)> object, and pops up a command-line interface.
Any SQL statement may be entered
and executed.  Statements can extend onto multiple lines, and
must end with a semi-colon.  The dialect of SQL is SQL-92 as
implemented by <link http://sqlite.org/docs.html SQLite>;
<xref sqldocument(n)> adds a number of new SQL functions.<p>

If the -create option is specified, the named SQLite database file will
be created.  If -create is used with a filename that already exists,
the command will be rejected.<p>

If the name of the database is the special name ":memory:"
then a new database is created in memory.  In this case the -create
option has no meaning.<p>

In addition to SQL statements, mars_sql(1) also accepts a number of
special commands; see <xref COMMANDS> for details.<p>

The result of SELECT queries will be displayed in either Multicolumn
or List mode.  Multicolumn mode displays the results in tabular form,
with one line of text per record and field names at the top of each
column; long values are truncated.  List mode displays each record
individually, with field labels and values in two parallel columns.
The default is Multicolumn mode; the mode may be changed from the
<b>View</b> menu or via the <iref .mode> command.<p>

By default, all entered queries are executed.  If "explain" mode is
enabled from the <b>View</b> menu or the toolbar, SQLite's "EXPLAIN
QUERY PLAN" statement will be used to retrieve information about the
tables and indexes used.<p>

<section MENUS>

mars_sql(1) provides the following menus:<p>

<subsection "File Menu">

<deflist>
  <def "Exit">
   Terminates the application.<p>
</deflist>

<subsection "Edit Menu">

<deflist>
  <def "Cut">
   Cuts selected text to the clipboard.<p>

  <def "Copy">
   Copies selected text to the clipboard.<p>

  <def "Paste">
   Pastes the text from the clipboard.<p>

  <def "Select All">
   Selects all text in the current widget.<p>
</deflist>

<subsection "View Menu">

<deflist>
  <def "Multicolumn Mode">
   Selects multicolumn output mode (<b>.mode mc</b>).<p>

  <def "List Mode">
   Selects list output mode (<b>.mode list</b>).<p>

  <def "Execute Mode">
   Executes SQL queries as usual.<p>

  <def "Explain Mode">
   Outputs a description of the tables and indices used by
       a query without actually executing it.  (This is equivalent to
       beginning the query with the words "EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN".)<p>
</deflist>

<section COMMANDS>

By default, all command input is assumed to be SQL.  mars_sql(1) also
supports a number of special commands, all of which begin with
".".  Special commands have Tcl syntax.<p>

<deflist commands>

<defitem ".mode" {.mode ?newMode?}>

By default, returns the current output mode, <b>mc</b> (multicolumn)
or <b>list</b>.  If <i>newMode</i> is given, sets the mode accordingly.<p>

<defitem ".schema" {.schema ?<i>table</i>?}>

By default, returns the SQL CREATE statements used to define all
tables, views, and indices in the database.  If given, <i>table</i>
may the name of a specific table, view, or index; or a glob pattern.
Either way, the output will include only the matching tables, views,
and indices.<p>

<defitem ".tables" {.tables}>

Returns a list of the names of the tables defined in the database.<p>

</deflist commands>
